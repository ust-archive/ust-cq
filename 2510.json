We will explore various techniques in digital audio workstation composition and sound processing, with an emphasis on the compositional topic of form. Our journey will be guided by focused listening and discussion of significant repertoire, as well as selected readings. We will also explore recently developed machine-learning-based technologies for sound processing and organization, touching on aesthetic and philosophical questions raised by such technologies. Students in the course will learn recording and production techniques in the University’s Electronic Music Studio and have access to the facility for developing their projects. The course will culminate in a concert-presentation of student works. Since we will primarily be working with concrete sound rather than musical abstractions, students need not have prior experience in music theory or composition to succeed in the course.",

The physical science basis, impacts, risk, mitigation and adaptation measures of climate change will also be investigated (including technical and social solutions). For local and regional vulnerabilities, such as extreme weather events, sea levels rise, storm surge and coastal flooding, will be covered. The significance of collective learning under the big history framework, both as a driver for our exponentially growing impacts, as well as for better solutions, will be highlighted.",

The course consists of two interrelated parts: hydrology and hydraulics. Hydrology covers various processes of water cycle (including precipitation, infiltration, rainfall-runoff modeling, and flow routings) that produce loads on hydrosystems. Hydraulics, on the other hand, applies fluid mechanics principles to the design and analysis the capacity of hydrosystems infrastructures such as pipe networks and channel networks as well as hydraulic machinery.",

Specifically, we will i) explain how a modern machine learning system (i.e., PyTorch) works; ii) understand the performance bottleneck of machine learning computation over modern hardware (e.g., Nvidia GPUs); iii) discuss four main parallel strategies in foundation model training (data-, pipeline-, tensor model-, optimizer- parallelism); and iv) real-world deployment of foundation model including efficient inference and fine-tuning.

    "description": "This introductory course provides a foundational overview of quantum information processing, aimed at students with little or no prior background in quantum theory. Topics include basic principles of quantum mechanics relevant to computation, qubits and quantum gates, superposition, entanglement, and simple quantum algorithms. The course emphasizes the computer science perspective, exploring how quantum concepts translate into computational models and problem-solving approaches. Students will engage with selected contemporary literature, gaining exposure to emerging research directions such as quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and distributed quantum computing via student-led presentations. As a culminating activity, students will work individually or in small groups on a focused, research-oriented project-developing it from inception to realization and delivering a final presentation. By the end of the course, participants will understand core concepts, appreciate the potential and limitations of quantum computation, and be equipped to follow to some extend current developments in the field.",

    "description": "All human endeavors are constrained by limited knowledge about the laws of nature, external events in the past, present and future, how other people (including ourselves) are going to behave, etc. Life is filled with decision problems without perfect information of their consequences. In view of these, research on the decision making and strategic interaction under risk and uncertainty have been extremely active for the past few decades. This course aims to provide an introduction to this exciting field of research and suggestions for further exploration. The first part of the course is devoted to the economics of uncertainty and covers topics including the expected-utility model, market allocation of risks and asset pricing. The second part of the course is devoted to the economics of information and covers topics including moral hazard, bargaining, auction theory, mechanism design, and information aggregation in the market.",

The first is to extend the understanding of open economy macroeconomic theory and international finance from simple reduced form models to micro-founded models with greater sophistication. The second purpose is to explain the relationship between macro variables and asset markets, - equity, fixed income, and foreign exchange, commodities etc. Topics may include current account sustainability and China-US bilateral trade imbalances, models of exchange rate determination, interest rate parity, carry trades, forward premium puzzle, balance of payment crises, hyperinflation, and international business cycles. After an introduction to equity and bond market valuation, applications are global, but a particular focus will be on Asia-Pacific equity markets. The use of data, via the use of factor analysis and the use and interpretation of economic and market related indicators, is presented. There will be an introduction to implementation of macro investment strategies via exchange traded funds (ETF), futures and options markets. Real world examples, together with finance industry samples of macro and investment strategy research are utilized throughout.",

    "description": "The performance of analog integrated circuits is fundamentally tied to the behavior of key building blocks, such as current mirrors and differential pairs. These components depend critically on the matching properties of paired MOSFETs. In advanced CMOS technology, these properties are influenced not only by channel width and length but also by layout-dependent effects and parasitic elements unique to scaled processes. This course explores the impact of these phenomena on analog circuit behavior, equipping students with practical methodologies to mitigate their influence and optimize circuit design.",

    "description": "This graduate-level course explores cutting-edge computer architecture in the era of artificial intelligence, with a focus on the hardware foundations that enable modern machine learning workloads. The course will give introduction on AI-centric CPU architecture (using RISC-V as example), GPGPU architecture, and the specialized AI hardware architectures, examining how these architectures balance throughput, efficiency, and scalability for AI workloads. A major emphasis is placed on algorithm-hardware co-design, highlighting how AI models and hardware should be co-optimized for maximum performance and energy and thermal efficiency. We also analyze advanced technology trends shaping the future of AI systems, including 3D integration, emerging memory technologies, and near-memory or in-memory computing. Students will critically evaluate the trade-offs in designing hardware for AI acceleration and explore how technology scaling impacts architectural choices. By the end, students will be able to understand, analyze, and conceptualize AI-centric architectures from both a systems and design perspective. Key Topics covers RISC-V Architecture for AI, GPGPU architecture and parallel execution models, Specialized AI hardware accelerators, Algorithm-hardware co-design strategies, Technology-driven architecture: 3D stacking, HBM, NVM, Near-memory and in-memory computing for AI, Performance/energy/thermal trade-offs in AI system design.",

    "name": "Human-AI Interaction in the Age of Generative Media",
    "description": "This interdisciplinary course offers research postgraduate students a rigorous foundation for critically engaging with the evolving relationship between humans and generative AI systems within global media and cultural industries. As generative tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, BLOOM, Gemini, and MidJourney become increasingly embedded in journalism, entertainment, creative production, heritage archiving, and digital storytelling, the study of Human–AI Interaction (HAII) has emerged as a vital area of inquiry across communication, design, ethics, and cultural studies. The course investigates how individuals and institutions interact with generative AI—how they prompt, interpret, co-create, negotiate meaning, and assess value alignment across diverse cultural and platform contexts. Students will engage with both foundational theories and emerging research in Human-Computer Interaction and Interaction Design, with a particular emphasis on the cognitive, social, cultural, and ethical dimensions of generative AI. Through thematic lectures, global case discussions, reflection labs, and applied research clinics, students will explore key topics including: 1. Cultural adaptation and misalignment in large language models (LLMs). 2. Narrative agency and AI co-authorship in media and creative production. 3. Emotional labor and synthetic identity in AI-mediated communication. 4. Bias, authenticity, and ethics in AI-generated cultural content. 5. Platform governance and the politics of generative content moderation. The course also emphasizes empirical research design methodologies tailored to communication and media studies, enabling students to translate theoretical insights into researchable questions and applied frameworks. No technical background is required. Students will emerge with the conceptual, methodological, and practical competencies to integrate HAII into their interdisciplinary research agendas.",

    "description": "The societal energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources requires novel energy technologies, with material design and engineering at the center of the innovation process. In this course, we will explain the enabling materials science and engineering behind advanced energy technologies by answering questions such as why lithium powers our batteries and why it takes silicon to make a solar panel. Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies.",

The design thinking process modules: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test, will be introduced and the students will learn experientially by applying these process modules to solve the health unmet needs they observe in real life. The students are required to report their progress throughout the semester. At the end of the course, they will showcase their prototype in a roadshow and submit their project report and reflection on their design journey. It is a common core course for students from different schools who have no background in design thinking or are looking for practical experience in design thinking.",

    "description": "Originated from Stanford University’s Life Design Lab (Bill Burnett and Dave Evans), this course employs a method called “design thinking” to help students from any program develop a constructive and effective approach to finding and designing their vocation after university. Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F.",

This course aims to inspire students to take a broader perspective on environmental issues, in addition to advancing the scientific knowledge of climate change and extreme weather events. To effectively achieve this purpose, the course introduces case studies that emphasize the huge implications of extreme events (e.g. drought, flood, heat waves, typhoon) and their linkage with global warming induced by human activities. This course also assesses the potential impacts of climate changes and extremes on social, economic and environmental sustainability through a multidisciplinary approach.",

While viable benchmarks and concepts for sustainable development exist, economic decision-makers and financial institutions by and large still focus on economic profit, leaving environmental and societal sustainability outside of their cost-benefit assessments.\nIn order to provide an alternative approach that guides financial investment towards green ventures, the course offers insights into sustainable development concepts and respective assessment mechanisms for sustainable corporate performance. These concepts and mechanisms are exemplified in the Circular Economy (CE) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which constitute increasingly important elements in sustainable development. By adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, the classes cover the fundamentals of sustainable concepts, benchmarks on how to measure sustainable performance in the economic domain (i.e., at the corporate-, meso- and system-level) and empirical cases on how green finance has and can make a difference to promote sustainable growth.",

    "description": "The integration of environmental and social practices is crucial to address environmental crises, including climate change, pollution, resource scarcity and social wellbeing. Amidst the emergence of greenwashing practices that falsely claim environmental preferability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprinting have become essential tools for providing quantitative evidence of a product's or system's environmental and social impact. This course takes a systems-thinking approach to sustainability issues and explores the application of LCA in a range of areas, including technology development, environmental reporting, investment, and policymaking. By doing so, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of products and systems over their entire life cycle and learn how to make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals. The course teaches students the concepts, methodology, and software skills needed to conduct LCA projects and interpret LCA reports. Students will be equipped to apply LCA to promote sustainable development in various contexts.",

    "description": "This course puts together a collection of industry cases, projects and academic papers on Sustainable Investing, also known as ESG Investing. It is an investment approach that integrates three additional factors - environment (E), social (S) and governance (G), into security analysis and portfolio allocation. As the industry successfully adopts these factors into their double bottom line financial analysis, only a handful of courses - such as this one - would tackle the subject. This course will discuss the market terminology, practices, usages and dollar impact of ESG factors. The main focus is on the identification, measurement and the materiality of ESG indicators. The students will learn that financial analysis with ESG integration provides the basis for a more informed investment decision. Discussion on existing academic papers will shed light on the cost and benefits of sustainable investing. This course will empower the students with cutting edge information, tools and solid research on the subject.",

Real-world examples, including personal experiences of the instructor in renowned VC firms like Khosla Ventures, Softbank, and Formation 8, are incorporated throughout the course. Furthermore, the course may feature a distinguished guest speaker who is a prominent founder of a venture capital firm in Asia. By the conclusion of the course, students will have acquired a deep understanding of the venture capital industry and will have honed the essential skills required to excel in it. Graded P or F.",

As the world’s oldest chess game, Weiqi is speculated to start around the 23rd century BC and be created by Emperor Yao. This course will cover the fundamental techniques of capturing stones, common life-and-death shapes, basic joseki, and opening theory in Weiqi, as well as how to complete a full game against an opponent. By participating in this Weiqi course, students can gain insights into the origin and development trajectory of Weiqi culture, stories of prominent figures, and its implications on artificial intelligence (AI), one of the hottest topics today. Weiqi is more than a game and a cultural carrier. It is hoped that Weiqi will become one of students’ lifelong hobbies.",

Situating art and digital culture within a cross-disciplinary context, the course also considers the following key issues: how do digital technologies change our art, culture, and contemporary life? How does art in the digital age define key issues in the digital world such as privacy, copyright, and identity? How can we create art through interdisciplinary practice? Students will learn to analyze new forms of art and related technologies, and to discuss the key issues of the body, identity, and surveillance in the digital age.",

Marco Polo stands for the first direct contact between Europe and China in the Age of the first Eurasian Globalization under the Mongol Empire, the model of East-West exchange. Yet everything known about him comes from his book, which was written more than 700 years ago and whose reliability has been often questioned. This course will introduce students to the text, his two authors and the wider historical context surrounding the travel and its written account. At the end of the course students will have acquired a deeper understanding of cultural exchange between Europe and China in the Middle Ages as well as in later periods, and know the answers to questions such as “Did Marco Polo go to China?” and “Did Marco Polo bring spaghetti back to Europe?”.",

    "description": "This course introduces the fundamental themes of intercultural communication by drawing on current language and intercultural communication theory, research, and practice, to better understand communication between culturally diverse individuals. Through experiential projects and personal reflections, students will explore what it means to be an interculturally competent communicator or mediator and develop competencies necessary for interacting more appropriately and effectively in intercultural encounters. By engaging with readings, observation, analyses of critical incidents, intercultural reflections exercises, and intercultural projects, students are encouraged to become more actively engaged with intercultural interactions and to foster an ethno-relative mindset, with greater curiosity and open-mindedness. Topics include conceptions of culture and multiculturalism, the relationship between language, communication, power and context, language and cultural socialization, ‘othering’, prejudice and stereotypes, intercultural rhetoric, facework and conflict management in workplace, intercultural transition and adjustment, intercultural relationship-building, social justice, and global citizenship.",

At its heart is the examination of a range of critical issues arising from the imbrication of science fiction with a range of key topics of interest, the rise of a planetary consciousness in conjunction with imperial utopianism, the politics of the writing of alternate histories, constructions of race and gender in post-humanist discourse, translation and techno-orientalism, among others.",

    "description": "This course traces the transmutation and reinvention of classical Chinese stories from ancient times to present era. What are the stories told once and again in Chinese culture? Is it true that each retelling is different? Or do things stay more or less the same despite changes of time? Are there perennial themes that thread through Chinese civilization? Is this a valid question? In this course, we engage these questions by putting examples in Chinese literature and culture from the past and the present into dialogue. Taking a transmedia approach, this course brings in both textual and visual materials from history, literature, and cinema. By juxtaposing materials of relevance from different times and carried by various media, we explore continuities and discontinuities in Chinese culture as well as the possibilities and limits each historical moment offers for cultural transformation.",

These case studies, analyzed through modern anthropological theory, unsettle popular unilinear narratives about human history while revealing the role of collective agency in shaping its course. In illuminating the past, the course will offer new ways of thinking about humanity’s future.",

Given the current crisis of climate change and environmental degradation, students will learn how to use ideas and insights from ‘Science’, ‘Technology’, ‘Arts’, ‘Politics’, ‘Ethics’ and ‘Spirituality’, to develop meaningful designs for products, services and/or communication strategies, that balance man-made needs with the integrity of natural eco-systems. Ideas from leading research in sustainable and ecological practices will be incorporated with methodologies from Design Thinking, Circular Design, Design Futuring and Design Fictions. Students will at the end of the course be able to understand the interdisciplinarity and interrelatedness of Eco-design and be able to use this understanding in their own daily practices and/or chosen professions.",

    "description": "The course is designed for 3rd year undergraduate students who have a very basic understanding of physics, math, and physical prototyping. The goal of the course is to introduce how to design mechanical machines and what are the basic design guidelines behind the hardware. In particular, it will answer the question of how to design the trajectories of a moving machine that satisfies all the mechanical requirements: (1) it moves in the way we want, and (2) the machine maintains mechanical strength that will not fail (e.g., material breakage, fatigue, jamming, and buckling) during operation. The course will cover some of the classical mechanisms and mechanical transmissions (e.g., gears, springs, bearings, linkages), modern mechanical machines in robotics (e.g., linear robot actuator, motorized stage), as well as emerging technologies in machine design (e.g., compliant mechanisms, tensegrity robots, magnetic robotics, 4D printing, etc.) to provide both the fundamentals and overview of mechanical machines and equip students with the skills to design their own simple mechanical machines. The course will focus on the basic mechanical principles and what are the design considerations during the implementations and the limitations in each mechanical system. This will encourage the students to consider the emerging applications where new mechanical machines are required, such as medical and marine robotic applications.",

    "description": "This course takes the manual design and creation of textile crafts as its entry point, dedicated to cultivating a breakthrough \"maker\" spirit in innovative thinking. By guiding students to transcend traditional material boundaries, the curriculum vigorously stimulates artistic freedom, achieving profound integration between craft techniques and emotional expression. Through the interlacing of yarns, learners will explore visual pathways to manifest their inner worlds, transforming their works beyond mere handicrafts to construct artistic bridges connecting imagination with reality. The interdisciplinary value of this course lies in revealing that a profound understanding of textile craftsmanship has become a vital catalyst for modern technological innovation. Though seemingly divergent, looms and robots fundamentally share common genetic codes of dexterity, resilience, and artistry. Building upon traditional craftsmanship inheritance, the course innovatively establishes a dialogic space where textile principles converse with modern technology. The intricate interplay of material tension, structural balance, and mechanical responsiveness during weaving resonates profoundly with the sensitivity calibration of robotic tactile systems and the adaptive control of soft robotics. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",

Identification of the problem through interactions with the staff of the sponsored company. Ideation. Design concept generation. Selection of ideas. Prototyping. Testing and redesigning. In addition, students have to consider sustainability, manufacturability, and marketability of the proposed product solutions, which have to fulfill needs of the client under a budgetary constraint. Students are expected to spend less time on planning and idea generation as they have already gained these experiences in the second year but more time on prototyping and testing, as this project requires application and integration of more advance technologies and design.

The first half of the course focuses on foundational topics such as waterproofing, buoyancy, propulsion, and basic control systems - core principles that apply to Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). These sessions equip students with practical skills for building functional underwater robots. In the second half, the course transitions to more advanced topics such as onboard sensing, computer vision, navigation, sensor fusion, and path planning - essential elements of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). This progression from ROV to AUV gives students a complete view of underwater robotics, from mechanical construction to autonomy and intelligence. By the end of the course, students will have designed, built, and tested their own AUV capable of autonomous maneuvering and object detection.",

It is exceptionally useful for training a large amount of unstructured historical datasets, and predicting the most-likely outputs. DL can be applied in many business areas such as finance, marketing, customer services, information security and so on, and most importantly DL can outperform existing non-AI systems due to the nature of neural networks. This course intends to introduce Python programming language for developing DL business applications. Students will apply knowledge in current and future trends of DL to design DL business applications.",

Harnessing AI’s potential for competitive performance requires a new type of professionals, who understand how machine learning (ML) works, what they can deliver and how they can be applied into different business context. This course is intended to bridge the gap between the business strategy and technical how-to. Through lectures, case discussion, and experiments in real-world data sets, students will gain a broad understanding of ML and AI concepts, explore the state-of-art use cases of AI technology in business, identify new opportunities and potential risks brought by AI, and recognize how to effectively communicate with the data science and machine learning team.",

The course is designed for anyone without relevant background, who is interested about how traditional theories of criminal behaviour apply to new forms of cybercrime, the psychological profiles of digital offenders, and the impact of these crimes on victims. It also discusses the role of law enforcement in addressing cybercrime, ethical concerns, and the implications of technology on criminal behaviour and vice versa.

The course also explores key aspects of Japanese culture, including greetings, social customs, and the appropriate use of language in formal and informal settings. Alternatively, students may opt for a flexible 8-week learning pathway that combines face-to-face sessions with online self-learning by taking LANG1211 Communicative Japanese for Beginners I (2 credits), which focuses on practical communication skills, and LANG1212 Japanese Vocabulary and Grammar Essentials I (1 credit), an online module that allows students to study vocabulary and grammar at their own pace.",

The course introduces students to the research skills for finding and evaluating sources for discipline-related writing and speaking tasks. Students are expected to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas from different sources when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students' competence in communicating effectively in a wider community beyond the university, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member and leader of a group. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

It aims to cultivate students’ logical expression skills in Chinese in the context of investigative study of culture. Students will learn how to describe cultural phenomena, summarize literature, and evaluate claims from a critical perspective. Students will also learn to construct arguments and support claims effectively in an academic style.

It increases student awareness of how writing creates change and convinces one to take action, and how audiences, contexts and genre call for different choices in language, organization, format and style. As students explore and analyze business genres, they learn how to shape and adapt their language skills, strategies and communication practices to meet the needs of various internal and external audiences including co-workers, supervisors, management and customers. The course also develops in students the ability to communicate in digital contexts by analyzing and producing texts including on email and social media. Students will develop a repertoire of language and communication skills and strategies and will write for various workplace needs. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

    "description": "This course equips students with the language and communication skills and strategies to speak and present professionally in internal and external business settings. It increases student awareness of how speaking and presenting creates change and convinces one to take action. As students explore and analyze spoken genres using language and communication theories, they learn how to shape and adapt their language skills, strategies and communication practices to influence various internal and external audiences including customers, co-workers and supervisors. Students will also develop ways to express themselves in multimodal settings. The course develops in students particularly with soft skills to handle sensitive business situations and incidents including a crisis, and how to communicate interculturally in diverse settings. Students will develop a repertoire of language and communication skills and strategies to meet various workplace needs. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

    "description": "Speech technology such as AI powered voice assistants on smart speakers and smartphones has become an integral part of everyday life. Development of speech technology requires a systematic understanding of human speech sounds. This course introduces students to Phonetics, the scientific study of the physical properties of human speech sounds. Students will learn the physical (acoustic) properties of different components of human speech, how speech sounds are produced and how the knowledge of Phonetics can be useful to speech technology and its development. Students will be actively engaged throughout the course through lectures, interactive tasks, and hands-on practice and learning activities. They will also conduct computerized acoustic analyses of speech sounds using freely available software and explore topics in Phonetics (e.g. foreign accent) or speech technology (e.g. synthesized speech) which are of interest or relevance to students. This course assumes no prior knowledge of Phonetics or speech technology.",

The course develops integrated language skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, while strengthening Japanese vocabulary, grammar, and cultural understanding. Over 13 weeks, students will acquire essential communication skills for daily interactions in class, such as giving instructions, asking for permission, explaining actions, and describing events. They will also gain insights into Japanese cultural norms, including the role of hierarchy and the appropriate use of language styles in different social contexts. Alternatively, students may choose a more flexible learning pathway to learn this course’s content: LANG 2201 Communicative Japanese for Beginners II (2 credits) focusing on practical communication skills, and LANG 2202 Japanese Vocabulary and Grammar Essentials II (1 credit) to learn the vocabulary and grammar online at their own pace. Students without prerequisite but with equivalent competence in Japanese may seek instructor's approval for enrollment in the course.",

Some ideas and principles of Bayesian including prior and posterior distributions, conjugate priors, Bayesian estimates, empirical Bayes, Bayesian hypothesis testing, Bayesian model selection and Bayesian networking are covered. Other Bayesian tools such as Bayesian decision theory, Bayesian data analysis, and Bayesian computational skills will also be discussed. An open-source, freely available software R will be used to implement these computational and data analytics skills. Hands-on experience and case studies such as pattern recognition and spam filtering will also be provided to students. Completion of this course will give students access to a wide range of Bayesian analytical tools, customizable to real data.",

In this course, we will explain the enabling materials science and engineering behind advanced energy technologies by answering questions such as why lithium powers our batteries and why it takes silicon to make a solar panel. Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies.",

Smart materials are a novel class of materials characterized by new and unique properties that can be altered in response to environmental stimuli. They can be used in a wide range of applications since they can exceed the current abilities of traditional materials, especially in environments where conditions are constantly changing. This course is designed to provide an integrated and complete knowledge of smart materials and meta-structures. The course will also introduce the state-of-the-art advances in applications of smart materials in sensors, actuators, energy harvesters, acoustic transducers, and microelectronic and mechanical systems. The course will lay a strong foundation for students' future research and career in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and material science.",

Recently animation theories began to emerge as a new field of research, offering critical interventions in film studies and even challenging our conventional views of the world. This course explores various theoretical issues in animation studies, such as movement, stasis, affect, automation and agency, TV serialization, digitality, media mix, sound, authorship and spectatorship, animals, race, gender, cuteness, animism and environment. Animated films made in China, Japan, and other parts of the world will be analyzed as case studies.",

The course will emphasize a theoretical understanding of human decision making, as well as a comprehension of the real world implications of our mistakes both for us and for our society, and what, if anything, can be done about it.",

Employing guest speakers, lectures, cases, contemporary readings, role-plays, fieldwork, reflective student writing, and discussion groups, the course engages students in a serious consideration of their own ethical standards as applied to their present academic environment and their future careers. Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions.

Technical and analytical skills are essential for early career success and reaching middle levels of management in any organization. A major theme of this class is that progressing past middle levels of success in entrepreneurship, management, and investing requires something different than the skills that allow one to reach the middle. Achieving greatness requires something different: an ability to influence others, motivate specific behavior, change perceptions, and generate support for desired outcomes. This ability is what distinguishes those who peak at middle management from those who go on to become exceptional leaders, executives, investors, or founders. Graded P or F.",

Topics to be discussed on the social dimension cover both learner-internal factors such as motivation, affect, agency and identity, and learner-external factors such as how social context affects language learning, at both the conversational and situational level, and social and cultural level.

    "description": "This course explores cutting-edge topics in vision-language models (VLMs) and AI-generated content (AIGC). In the first half, we focus on VLMs and their foundations: covering models like LLAVA, InternVL, QWen, and more advanced architectures such as mixture-of-experts and retrieval-augmented models. Topics include reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and associated challenges in scalability and ethics. Besides image-level understanding, this part also sheds light on VLMs for video-level understanding, e.g., event/action captioning and localization. The second half shifts focus to AIGC, exploring how generative models revolutionize content creation across text, image, video, and 3D. We will analyze their technical mechanisms, including model architectures and system design, as well as broader societal implications, such as ethical risks and creative disruption. Throughout the course, students will read and present key papers, lead discussions, and complete a hands-on research project. This advanced graduate course requires prior knowledge of machine learning, NLP, and deep learning architectures such as Transformers and Diffusion Models.",

    "description": "PHYS 1111 and PHYS 1112 target students who have learned the most basic knowledge in physics in high school. Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. Students without the physics prerequisite but who have taken PHYS 1101 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but who have taken MATH 1012/ MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.",

Information theory was developed by Shannon in the 1940s as a tool for optimizing communication systems in telephone networks. But how is the concept of entropy used by communications engineers related to that introduced a century earlier in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics? And what does information theory tell us about the physical limits of computation? Topics studied include communication systems, probability and random variables, discrete information sources, information and entropy, joint and conditional entropy, relative entropy and mutual information, capacity of a noiseless channel, source coding, capacity of a noisy channel, Bayesian probability, maximum entropy and thermodynamics, and Maxwell’s demon.",

The pre-crisis faith that free markets produce optimal outcomes has been significantly eroded. A decade on, global policymakers still struggle to engage with a more empirically-grounded and less dogmatic brand of economics, and the differing prescriptions that it might suggest. Students of economics need to have an overview of the causes and consequences of the crisis, the ideas that contributed to it, and how those ideas and their policy implications are being challenged and debated. Most importantly, students of public policy need to be able to understand what went wrong – both in economics, and in policy.",

These issues often involve the allocation of resources (not just governmental resources, but also society’s) and have implications for efficiency and equity. Sometimes, these issues involve difficult trade-offs between efficiency and equity. How are we to decide? Should efficiency consideration always trump equity ones? The course is designed to familiarize students with the methods, strengths and limitations of economic reasoning in addressing these issues. Concepts covered in this course are drawn from both micro- and macroeconomics. Illustrations are conducted in an interactive manner using cases studies as well as widely cited examples in public management.",

    "description": "This course introduces students to the complex workings of global offshore finance, the parallel universe of secretive tax havens and unscrupulous accountants, lawyers, bankers, and other professionals that enable the world’s wealthiest individuals, multinational enterprises, transnational criminal networks, and rogue states to circumvent their societal obligations. First, it explains how global offshore finance operates and why it has grown so influential within the global economy. After that, it examines its impact on a wide range of global political, economic, social, and security challenges. Finally, it explores the evolving regulatory and legislative landscape designed to curb its worst excesses. The course will appeal to students pursuing careers in international institutions, national regulatory agencies, consulting and advisory firms, corporate compliance departments, think tanks, civil society organizations, news media outlets, and other relevant bodies.",

    "description": "This course delves deeply into the opportunities, challenges, barriers, and trajectories of integrating historical thinking and reasoning in policymaking. Students will be encouraged to leverage historical knowledge and evidence to develop innovative approaches to examining current and future policies. Through a comprehensive exploration of theoretical frameworks and historical case studies from Hong Kong and around the globe, students will be trained to scrutinise issues surrounding the “usability” of history, including the use, misuse, and abuse of historical narratives, as well as critical concepts such as causality, contingency, and analogies. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to formulate policy opinions on contemporary issues, grounded in historical context and with clear policy relevance. Inspired by the historian Marc Bloch’s concept of “historical sensibility,” this course aims to instil in students a profound appreciation for how historical perspectives can inform and enhance public policy. Ultimately, this course prepares students to become adept at using history responsibly to shape effective and informed policies for the future, fostering a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between the past and present in the realm of public policy.",

    "name": "The Economics and Policy of Climate Change",
    "description": "Climate change is potentially the most challenging long-term issue that the global community will face in the 21st century. To date, policies and strategies to mitigate global climate change have been insufficient to dramatically lessen the expected damages. The impacts of climate change will amplify the effects of already existing stresses on degraded terrestrial and marine resources and exacerbate income and welfare inequality. At least in the early stages, these impacts will create winners and losers, redistributing crop production, perturbing the hydrological cycle, and altering ecosystem services, among other natural and social consequences. If climate change is allowed to proceed unchecked, in the long-term, the ranks of winners will dwindle as impacts increase in scope and severity. The climate issue is inherently interdisciplinary. The main goal of this course is to challenge students to think across disciplinary boundaries. We will discuss a range of theories and methodologies, some of which may be unfamiliar to some students due to the variety of their educational backgrounds. Although the main methodological approach will be grounded in economic theory, the intent is for students to gain a degree of comfort with different analytical methods in order to question the assumptions, and debate, critique, or justify the use of different methodologies in addressing particular aspects of problems relating to scientific, policy, and social dimensions of the broad climate issue.",

But on the other hand, two major disruptive changes in global markets- the rising of Geopolitical tension, and the AI evolvement and impacts to the society- brings significant barrier for Chinese companies playing in global markets, particularly for those high-tech companies.

Major topics discussed in the course include the interactions between legal institutions and the party‐state (i.e., the party and the government), the behavior of legal workers (e.g., judges, police officers), citizens’ use of civil lawsuits and administrative litigation, and some important mechanisms through which citizens or other social actors seek justice in China.",

The focus will be on the specification of models including choice of control variables, the interpretation of results, handling missing data, and the challenges posed by reverse causality, omitted variable bias, endogeneity, and other issues that commonly arise in the analysis of social data. The second part introduces analytical strategies for “unconventional” data types, such as social network, web data, and plain texts. Special attention will be given to challenges to social scientists regarding data extraction, data integration, and visualization.",

Topics will include education, gendered social movements, men and women in the workplace, intimate relationships, family and sexuality (including LGBT), gender, science, technology and innovation, gendered violence and gender in the global economy.

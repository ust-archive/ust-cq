After that, the students will perform on-wafer testing, failure analysis, package selection, PCB design, test vector generation, reliability screening, ESD testing and data-sheet writing. Students completing this class are expected to have the equivalent experience of completing a full IC design cycle in the industry. May be graded PP.",

By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze, design, and implement art exhibitions that effectively incorporate digital technology and interactive elements. They will engage in hands-on prototyping sessions to explore various technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and generative AI. Additionally, students will participate in workshops that emphasize collaborative problem-solving and creative brainstorming, allowing them to develop practical skills in installation and project management for cultural spaces like the Fringe Club and Tai Kwun in Hong Kong. Industry professionals will share their insights through guest lectures and interactive workshops, fostering a participatory learning environment. Assessment will consist of quizzes, a reflection report, and a final group practicum project that involves creating a tech-based exhibition prototype at the Fringe Club’s Underground Theater to celebrate the Lunar New Year.",

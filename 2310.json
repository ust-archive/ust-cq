In such a longer time scale, overview of stars, planetary and species evolution, as well as concepts in climate change and how it is related to sustainability of the planet’s environment for its current inhabitants, including humanity, will be discussed. The physical science basis, impacts, risk, mitigation and adaptation measures of climate change will also be investigated (including technical and social solutions). For local and regional vulnerabilities, such as extreme weather events, sea levels rise, storm surge and coastal flooding, will be covered. The significance of collective learning under the big history framework, both as a driver for our exponentially growing impacts, as well as for better solutions, will be highlighted.",

In weekly large-class settings, students will work with an economics instructor on interpreting and explaining data, applying economic principles to daily life, building and supporting an argument, and evaluating different perspectives in scholarly debates. In weekly small-group tutorials, a language instructor will lead discussions to analyse texts and workshop individual students’ writing. At the end of the course students will be better prepared to undertake independent research and writing in their economics coursework, as well as to write from an economics perspective for a range of non-academic purposes.

Some recent topics include: COVID-19, Brexit, the Global Financial Crisis, and contemporary issues such as the resurgence of inflation. While students will read global case studies (Asia, Europe, South America), the emphasis will be on analyzing current events in real time, such as communications from central banks and global policy bodies such as the Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank or the IMF.",

It develops a formal macroeconomic framework for analysing the impact of policy decisions and economic shocks on major asset classes - equity, fixed income, foreign exchange, among others. While the framework is global and multi-asset, the focus is on Asia-Pacific equity markets. The use of data, whether it be via the use of factor analysis or the use and interpretation of economic and market related indicators, is emphasized throughout. The important role of central banks and monetary policy in the relationship between policy and asset prices, is a common theme. Real world examples – either current or from first-hand experience – are commonly used alongside theory.",

By learning the advanced methods for quantitative macroeconomic research and their applications, students can understand macroeconomic research at the frontier better. It will also help students develop their research ideas and find proper methodological approaches to the questions.",

Even two MOSFETs with the same width and the same length, their properties are not identical due to process variations and various non-ideal effects such as layout dependent effects (LDEs) and parasitic elements in CMOS technology. In this course, students will learn about how the above-mentioned effects affect analog circuit performance, and what kinds of methodologies can be used to minimize their impacts.",

Using these basic building blocks and robotic concepts, students will learn how to design and build a robot prototype that meets certain design specifications. Design examples include a mobile robot to engage in a competition, a robotic manipulator in a typical assembly task, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a surveillance application, etc.",

In this course, we will explain the enabling materials science and engineering behind advanced energy technologies by answering questions such as why lithium powers our batteries and why it takes silicon to make a solar panel. Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies.",

The goal of this course is to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, teamwork, analytical, design and project management skills through a multi‐disciplinary, team‐based design experience. The design thinking process modules: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test, will be introduced and the students will learn experientially by applying these process modules to solve the health unmet needs they observe in real life. The students are required to report their progress throughout the semester. At the end of the course, they will showcase their prototype in a roadshow and submit their project report and reflection on their design journey. It is a common core course for students from different schools who have no background in design thinking or are looking for practical experience in design thinking.",

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F.",

This course aims to inspire students to take a broader perspective on environmental issues, in addition to advancing the scientific knowledge of climate change and extreme weather. To effectively achieve this purpose, the course introduces the case studies that emphasize the huge implications of extreme events (e.g. drought, flood, heat waves, typhoon) and their linkage with the warming due to greenhouse gases. This course also assesses the potential impacts of climate changes and extremes on social, economic and environmental sustainability through a multidisciplinary approach.",

While viable benchmarks and concepts for sustainable development exist, economic decision-makers and financial institutions by and large still focus on economic profit, leaving environmental and societal sustainability outside of their cost-benefit assessments.\nIn order to provide an alternative approach that guides financial investment towards green ventures, the course offers insights into sustainable development concepts and respective assessment mechanisms for sustainable corporate performance. These concepts and mechanisms are exemplified in the Circular Economy (CE) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which constitute increasingly important elements in sustainable development. By adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, the classes cover the fundamentals of sustainable concepts, benchmarks on how to measure sustainable performance in the economic domain (i.e., at the corporate-, meso- and system-level) and empirical cases on how green finance has and can make a difference to promote sustainable growth.",

    "description": "The integration of environmental and social practices is crucial to address environmental crises, including climate change, pollution, resource scarcity and social wellbeing. Amidst the emergence of greenwashing practices that falsely claim environmental preferability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprinting have become essential tools for providing quantitative evidence of a product's or system's environmental and social impact. This course takes a systems-thinking approach to sustainability issues and explores the application of LCA in a range of areas, including technology development, environmental reporting, investment, and policymaking. By doing so, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of products and systems over their entire life cycle and learn how to make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals. The course teaches students the concepts, methodology, and software skills needed to conduct LCA projects and interpret LCA reports. Students will be equipped to apply LCA to promote sustainable development in various contexts.",

    "description": "This course puts together a collection of industry cases, projects and academic papers on Sustainable Investing, also known as ESG Investing. It is an investment approach that integrates three additional factors - environment (E), social (S) and governance (G), into security analysis and portfolio allocation. As the industry successfully adopts these factors into their double bottom line financial analysis, only a handful of courses - such as this one - would tackle the subject. This course will discuss the market terminology, practices, usages and dollar impact of ESG factors. The main focus is on the identification, measurement and the materiality of ESG indicators. The students will learn that financial analysis with ESG integration provides the basis for a more informed investment decision. Discussion on existing academic papers will shed light on the cost and benefits of sustainable investing. This course will empower the students with cutting edge information, tools and solid research on the subject.",

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

    "description": "Languages are considered complex repositories of cultures, where meanings are created and articulated, verbally and non-verbally, about the artefacts, norms, beliefs, and values of cultures. Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

In the past two centuries, the classical civilizations of East Asia met new challenges: the disintegration of old political systems, the growth of social tensions, and the arrival of an aggressive and expanding West. This course will study the internal and external tensions that undermined the traditional orders, compelling China, Japan, and Korea to seek new political and social reforms. Special attention will be given to the revolutionary changes in society, thought, culture, and the rise of a new political order in twentieth-century China, Japan, and Korea.",

Through looking at the history, art and science of map making, the course will guide students to reflect on and find answers to these questions: how to look at ancient maps? How to identify and interpret place names, objects, peoples and animals depicted in the maps, and how to distinguish the real from the imaginary? Who made these maps, for whom, and for what purposes? How were the images of China produced by Chinese different from those by European cartographers?",

Students will develop an understanding of how texture, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, melodic development, and other parameters interact to create music. Examples used in the class will be drawn mostly, but not exclusively, from classical repertoire. Although prior musical training will be helpful, there are no prerequisites for the course.",

Since we will be working with 'concrete sound', students need not have any prior experience in music notation or composition to participate in the course. The course will culminate in an open concert-presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester.",

    "description": "This course aims to stimulate students' thinking and broaden their knowledge about language in relation to migration in the contemporary multilingual world. This is a world which is a product of mobility of people, information and products across physical and virtual boundaries. Languages themselves are changed through migration. Within a context of linguistic diversity, language is central to the organization of institutions, access to information, the exchange of goods and the ability to communicate. Students will investigate how language is used by migrants in areas including health, education, the law and employment. They will explore how language practices are shaped by face-to-face and mediated encounters and by the constraints of political and institutional contexts. Key questions are: What languages and forms of communication get used, when, why and where? What linguistic factors enable and limit access for migrants to services and resources? What are the consequences?",

The course considers major Russian literary texts which exemplify key trends in Russian literary culture - the fantastic and the absurd in literary mythmaking (the \"St. Petersburg myth\"); Realism, revolutionary utopianism, and its discontents; the Soviet experience from revolutionary avant-garde modernism to Stalinist Socialist Realism; Russian Eurasianism and post-Soviet postmodernism. The course will also explore relevant works of Russian literary criticism by noted critics of the 19th century, Russian Formalists, Soviet Semioticians, Russian Eurasianists, and others.",

Students learn about fundamental design theories, principles, and methods through a project-based learning approach. Students then experience several stages of a creative design process. The process begins by asking students to identify real-world problems through social, business, scientific, and technological perspectives. To add specificity, students will be able to describe the behaviors and needs of social interactions, observe demographic phenomena, assess business viability, and identify and understand technological changes and impacts, etc. After defining a problem statement, students will be guided to generate creative solutions using brainstorming tools and creative thinking skills. Selected solutions will be presented in form of prototypes and open for user feedback. This course emphasizes the appreciation of the role and significance of design for our society.",

We take a design-focused view, expanding the design requirements into an exploration of material properties for given shapes. This will lead naturally into a deeper understanding of functional properties and structures of materials on the one hand, and deformation and failure modes of solid mechanical objects on the other. Various material families, including metals, alloys, polymers, copolymers, and composites will be studied, and a basic understanding of how shape affects mechanical performance will be introduced. In the projects, the choice of optimal materials and shapes of an object will be determined using the design thinking approach. Instructor's approval is required.",

The project is expected to be of increased technical complexity compared with the second year project. Project planning. Distribution of tasks among the team members. Identification of the problem through interactions with the staff of the sponsored company. Ideation. Design concept generation. Selection of ideas. Prototyping. Testing and redesigning. In addition, students have to consider sustainability, manufacturability, and marketability of the proposed product solutions, which have to fulfill needs of the client under a budgetary constraint. Students are expected to spend less time on planning and idea generation as they have already gained these experiences in the second year but more time on prototyping and testing, as this project requires application and integration of more advance technologies and design. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",

Harnessing AI’s potential for competitive performance requires a new type of professionals, who understand how machine learning (ML) works, what they can deliver and how they can be applied into different business context. This course is intended to bridge the gap between the business strategy and technical how-to. Through lectures, case discussion, and experiments in real-world data sets, students will gain a broad understanding of ML and AI concepts, explore the state-of-art use cases of AI technology in business, identify new opportunities and potential risks brought by AI, and recognize how to effectively communicate with the data science and machine learning team.",

Companies face increasing pressure to become more sustainable from various stakeholders, such as policymakers, shareholders, investors, and NGOs. At the same time, consumers demand more sustainable products and services. While many organizations have established goals to reduce emissions or become carbon neutral in the next 10 to 20 years, they struggle to translate these goals into specific actions and strategies. People in organizations may ask questions like: How do we scope the analysis of our supply chains? What is the proper methodology to estimate emissions? This course will highlight pathways for how you can help build sustainable supply chains for organizations to achieve their sustainability goals.",

It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement.",

    "description": "This course puts a strong emphasis on developing university-level academic literacy and communication competence in writing, speaking, and multimodal contexts. The course introduces students to research skills using university library resources for finding and evaluating sources for academic writing and speaking tasks. It expects students to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students’ competence in communicating effectively in an academic community, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member of a group and assuming responsibility as a discussion facilitator in the context of student-led seminars. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

The course integrates the three elements of communication skills, academic literacy, and culture with a focus on Chinese writing training. The emphasis is on using Chinese to examine and discuss various cultural issues such as language culture. Students can have a deeper understanding of selected cultural issues and be able to discuss relevant topics in Chinese writing.",

The principal objectives of this course are to introduce techniques to study random walks on general weighted (potentially random) graphs, and to investigate the profound connections between the behavior of random walks and the underlying graph topology using tools from potential theory, geometric group theory, and electrical networks. Later parts of this course cover selected advanced topics such as local limits of random walks, mixing/cutoff phenomena, or directed polymers. Some familiarity with measure-theoretic probability theory (as in MATH 5411) is helpful, but not strictly necessary to follow this course.",

    "description": "The societal energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources requires novel energy technologies, with material design and engineering at the center of the innovation process. In this course, we will explain the enabling materials science and engineering behind advanced energy technologies by answering questions such as why lithium powers our batteries and why it takes silicon to make a solar panel. Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies.",

Smart materials are a novel class of materials characterized by new and unique properties that can be altered in response to environmental stimuli. They can be used in a wide range of applications since they can exceed the current abilities of traditional materials, especially in environments where conditions are constantly changing. This course is designed to provide an integrated and complete knowledge of smart materials and meta-structures. The course will also introduce the state-of-the-art advances in applications of smart materials in sensors, actuators, energy harvesters, acoustic transducers, and microelectronic and mechanical systems (MEMS). The course will lay a strong foundation for your future research and career in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and material science.",

What do the beliefs and theories of the past tell us about our relationship to music? What does music tell us about being human and of the world we inhabit? In an effort to answer these questions, we will be discussing topics ranging from psychoacoustics and fractals to celestial harmonies and birdsong, as well as listening to repertoire spanning from ancient Greek compositions to tracks by contemporary computational artists.",

Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions. For Business students only.",

The topics discussed are closely related to world-wide current events that affect transnational law and dispute resolution. The lectures examine how domestic laws, and regional and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. The course covers decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that affect the activities and governance of private and state-owned multinational corporations. Students will learn how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration, mediation, and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy.",

    "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have utterly transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP) in the last 3-4 years. These relevant foundation models are becoming ubiquitous in solving a wide range of tasks not limited to natural language understanding, notably in generation tasks in computer vision, for instance. These models on the other hand have given rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. This course aims to cover contemporary LLM topics centering around pre-trained language models (BERT, GPT, T5 models, mixture-of-expert models, retrieval-based models), emerging capabilities (knowledge, reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning, computer vision), fine-tuning and adaptation, as well as security and ethics. We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end, in a group of 2-3 students. This is an advanced graduate course and all the students are expected to have taken machine learning and preferably NLP courses, and should be familiar with deep learning models such as Transformers.",

Very often the pollution source is either concealed or diffuse without an apparent point of discharge. The tracking of pollution source is essential to accurate assessment of the ecosystem and health consequences as well as effective mitigation and remedial actions. Pollution source tracking is a cross-disciplinary challenge, involving knowledge and skills in microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, hydrodynamics, etc. This course serves to provide an in-depth understanding of the principle of pollution source tracking, the cutting-edge technology in the field and also case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world.",

This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course.

It comprises 2 parts: Part 1 aims to equip all full-time research postgraduate (RPg) students with basic teaching skills before assuming teaching assistant duties for the department. Good teaching skills can be acquired through learning and practice.  This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course. MPhil students are required to give at least one 30-minute session of instructional delivery in front of a group of students for one term. PhD students are required to give at least one such session each in two different terms. Graded PP, P or F.",

The pre-crisis faith that free markets produce optimal outcomes has been significantly eroded. A decade on, global policymakers still struggle to engage with a more empirically-grounded and less dogmatic brand of economics, and the differing prescriptions that it might suggest. Students of economics need to have an overview of the causes and consequences of the crisis, the ideas that contributed to it, and how those ideas and their policy implications are being challenged and debated. Most importantly, students of public policy need to be able to understand what went wrong – both in economics, and in policy.",

These issues often involve the allocation of resources (not just governmental resources, but also society’s) and have implications for efficiency and equity. Sometimes, these issues involve difficult trade-offs between efficiency and equity. How are we to decide? Should efficiency consideration always trump equity ones? The course is designed to familiarize students with the methods, strengths and limitations of economic reasoning in addressing these issues. Concepts covered in this course are drawn from both micro- and macroeconomics.

The course will also provide in-depth coverage of the circumstances and main actors behind these reform efforts, and the factors underlying their successes and failures. Considering that Hong Kong itself has been an integral part of the global offshore economy, the course will be useful to those interested in the city’s role as both a major global financial center and a financial gateway between China and the rest of the world. More importantly, it will be useful to those pursuing careers with national regulatory authorities, international organizations, corporate compliance departments, news media outlets, think tanks, consultancies, NGOs, and other public, private, and civil society sector bodies, as well as to those simply wishing to understand the world better and make a difference.",

    "description": "AI has emerged as a transformative technology that is changing broad aspects of business, competition, product development, innovation, and the nature of work. Breakthroughs have been coming at ever increasing speeds, bringing both opportunities and challenges. How should corporations, businesses, and individuals respond and position themselves in this emerging environment? How can businesses leverage the power of AI to increase their product competitiveness? Tapping into the instructor’s direct personal experience with concrete case examples, students will gain an industry insider’s view that goes beyond theory to cover actionable guidelines, practical tips, and best practices (including identifying situations where theory may not work in practice). By examining the differing modes of product development in Silicon Valley and China, this course provides a new framework and approach for product innovation in the Age of AI. Graded P or F.",

It is deliberately designed as complementary to a formal and theoretically-oriented introductory statistics course. This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of the course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn to real-world data. Upon completion of the course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as a better understanding of quantitative social scientific research. Not to be taken by students admitted to BSc Quantitative Social Analysis from 2022-23 and onwards.",

    "description": "This course discusses key concepts in politics using films as course materials. Movies illustrate human lives and feelings in a dramatic way, which often allows us to experience historical events or lives in the other side of the world indirectly. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the field of political science and key events in political history by watching movies describing them. Often political concepts such as state, democracy, dictatorship, repression and protest, representation, and election, are considered too abstract or too complicated. Addressing those concepts through movies will allow students to understand those concepts with living examples and empathy. The course explores important political topics and themes including political power and election, democracy, protest and repression, media, corruption, and war. By watching movies, attending lectures, and participating in discussions, students not only learn these concepts but also understand that political issues are part of our society and history and have a substantial influence on individual's life.",

It will discuss the normative foundations of democracy, the relationship between individual rights and rule by majority; the procedural and substantive aspects of democracy, and how to conceptualize the common good or public interest in democracy. It encourages students to apply the knowledge of democracy learnt in class to critically evaluate existing political systems and diverse social issues that they face in everyday life. Through in-depth examination of democracy as a normative value, this course will also encourage students to reflect the implications of democracy as a theory to various practical socio-political issues in today’s world.",

The second part introduces analytical strategies for “unconventional” data types, such as social network, web data, and plain texts.

    "description": "Designed for students with prior knowledge in statistics and linear regression, this advanced course covers a wide variety of generalized linear models for categorical dependent variables that are commonly used in social science research, as well as such alternatives as quantile regression and robust regression. It also introduces selected models for complex data structures, including multilevel analysis, time-series analysis, and survival analysis. This course will address such model specifications as random- and fixed-effects and other topics. The course will be application oriented with special attention paid to estimation of the aforementioned models using social science datasets.",

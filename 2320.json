As a continuation of ENGG 1010, students are required to attend a few seminars from a series of seminars offered by the school each year. The seminars cover areas including the ethical and environmental responsibilities as an engineer, the importance and the considerations of safety and health related issues in engineering designs and solutions, and in general the impact of engineering to the society. This course helps to provide the needed components for meeting the accreditation requirement and also helps to broaden the students' horizon in different engineering disciplines.

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

Unfortunately, most leaders must learn this fact by hard experience. Furthermore, they are never exposed to the expanding science of happiness, which contains a wealth of information on how to be happier as a leader and make others happier as well.",

Through an interdisciplinary approach combining economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, and history, students will engage with key debates on development, institutions, identity, and governance across the region. Special attention will be given to how post-Soviet transformations, globalization, and China's Belt and Road Initiative reshape markets, governance, and social relations. The course is suitable for students interested in international development, global business strategy, and international organizations. It will be valuable both for students new to Central Eurasia who wish to build academic knowledge, research capacity, and policy or commercial insight, and for students from the region seeking alternative analytical perspectives informed by global scholarship.",

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

Delivered through a collaboration between HKUST, the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, and Hong Kong Maritime Museum, the course combines academic expertise with industry and museum-based learning. Students examine how climate dynamics shape the ocean, how coastal and marine environments respond to change, and how meteorology and extreme weather events have influenced Hong Kong's development. Sessions held both on campus and at the Maritime Museum blend scientific foundations with historical perspectives, hands-on activities, and engagement with real instruments, archives, and gallery collections. Students will also explore the global maritime industry, including the role of the International Maritime Organization, the decarbonization of shipping, and the functions of shipowners and shipbrokers. The course provides a multidimensional understanding of how oceans and shipping connect societies, economies, and the planet.",

It’s the truest way to understand the world around you and answer existential questions. This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and principles, ranging from the origin of life, the genetic basis of evolution and biodiversity, the chemical basis of life, cell structure and organ functions in humans, conservation, ecology and behavioral biology. How Chinese medicine views life and aging in humans will also be discussed briefly. Examples and case studies will be illustrated to enhance students’ understanding and application of relevant knowledge.

    "description": "This course is designed for the curious student, the hands-on maker, and the aspiring engineer who wants to build the skills that will define the future of technology. No extensive background in theories is required, just a passion for creating and problem-solving. You and your team will brainstorm a unique, Arduino-powered device, design its custom enclosure using industry-standard CAD software like SolidWorks, and use motion simulation tools to test its work mechanism before it even exists. You'll then bring your digital design into the physical world through 3D printing and assemble a fully functional prototype for a final head-to-head competition. What makes this course unique is your \"AI Teammate.\" You won’t just be told about AI; you will learn the art of collaborating with it. You'll practice prompt engineering to unlock creative ideas and accelerate technical work. More importantly, you will learn the essential skill of critically evaluating AI-generated content, validating its suggestions, and making the final engineering judgments yourself. The course culminates in an exciting, high-energy Gadget Competition where you'll put your creation to the test. You'll pitch your final design, explain your innovation journey, and demonstrate the real-world skills you’ve acquired.",

Very often the pollution source is either concealed or diffuse without an apparent point of discharge. The tracking of pollution source is essential to accurate assessment of the ecosystem and health consequences as well as effective mitigation and remedial actions. Pollution source tracking is a cross-disciplinary challenge, involving knowledge and skills in microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, hydrodynamics, etc. This course serves to provide an in-depth understanding of the principle of pollution source tracking, the cutting-edge technology in the field and also case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world.",

That is, we will explore gender as the product of culture, groups and organizations and pay attention to behaviors and ways of thinking that are so taken-for-granted that we often fail to question them, with an eye to examining gender inequalities. Topics will include education, gendered social movements, men and women in the workplace, intimate relationships, family and sexuality (including LGBT), gender, science, technology and innovation, gendered violence and gender in the global economy. The focus of our discussions will be on gender in Hong Kong and China.",

It includes the topics found in COMP 1023 that are not covered in COMP 1021.The course goes into greater detail on the concepts from COMP 1021 and covers more advanced topics, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Students will engage in these topics through self-learning of course materials and guided programming exercises. Students without the prerequisites but with relevant programming knowledge may seek the instructor's approval to enroll in the course. Graded P or F.",

After that, the students will perform on-wafer testing, failure analysis, package selection, PCB design, test vector generation, reliability screening, ESD testing and data-sheet writing. Students completing this class are expected to have the equivalent experience of completing a full IC design cycle in the industry. May be graded PP.",

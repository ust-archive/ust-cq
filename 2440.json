Topics include business and individual location decisions, land use, urban amenities, agglomeration economies, local governance, etc. The course covers empirical methods for urban policy analysis, such as non-parametric estimations, spatial regression-discontinuity (RD) designs, the hedonic model, and discrete choice models. This course also discusses advanced general equilibrium models used in contemporary urban literature, including household sorting models, and quantitative spatial models. Students will learn basic tools for the visualization of spatial GIS data, and analytical tools for empirical evaluations of urban policies.",

Students in this course will be divided into design teams with a common goal: construct their project artifact or virtual 3D model, taken from a wide range of engineering and design contexts. There will be three main aspects: engineering skills, design/creativity, and teamwork. Fundamental engineering skills will be introduced in different engineering fields, such as 3D modelling or hands-on prototyping skills, along with exposure to various kinds of advanced technology available. Some class sessions will focus on design thinking and creativity. They are key to creating practical and interesting products. Students will work together in teams to realize their common idea of their final roadshow project, to have a real-world experience working with a design team.",

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

The course will discuss topics such as the invention and innovation of the telephone; the attempt to predict earthquakes; how citizen science saved birds and humans from chemical poisoning; the modern survival of ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine; shifting ideas about robots; and how and why young people invented the personal computer, among others. By the end of the course, students will have a much clearer picture of how science, technology, and medicine are co-produced socially and culturally, and be able to apply those lessons to the world we live in now.",

We will explore the nature of sound and approaches to its organization -- listening deeply to music and the world around us -- and cover theory and practice in digital audio signal processing. Since we will be working with 'concrete sound', students need not have any prior experience in music notation or composition to participate in the course. The course will culminate in an open concert-presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester.",

    "description": "Disruption has its roots “out there” – in the external environment. Innovation and technology, geo[1]economic/political uncertainties, pandemics, war, supply chain disruptions, changing social, demographic, and regulatory challenges, etc. are shockwaves rippling across the globe with no short[1]term solution in sight. The exponential nature of these changes requires leaders to rethink and employ different approaches and skills. Organizations and leaders must be vigilant in transforming their mindset and behaviors to ensure agility, resilience, and successful execution of strategy. \n\nThis course focuses on the impact of such exponential disruptions through the lens of a diverse set of organizations through transformation journeys. These journeys include digitalization, international market expansion, make agile teams work, lead innovative projects, re-imagine customer relationships, implement ESG strategy, etc. – with the aim to identify and seize significant future-proofing opportunities. In addition, this course will cover industries such as banking/financial services, global industrials, family business, media and entertainment, social commerce and fast fashion, etc., in both global and Asian contexts. \n\nShould you choose to enroll, this course is highly valuable to those who may have a lingering feeling that changes/disruptions are accelerating exponentially, thus keeping abreast of these changes has become increasingly challenging. This course will provide mental frameworks, practical tools, and a platform for cross-learning in a VUCA environment where no one has all the answers – from where we may work together to discover useful ways, and perhaps silver linings, for our professional and leadership development.",

Very often the pollution source is either concealed or diffuse without an apparent point of discharge. The tracking of pollution source is essential to accurate assessment of the ecosystem and health consequences as well as effective mitigation and remedial actions. Pollution source tracking is a cross-disciplinary challenge, involving knowledge and skills in microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, hydrodynamics, etc. This course serves to provide an in-depth understanding of the principle of pollution source tracking, the cutting-edge technology in the field and also case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world.",

We will delve into public market equity funding, notably the initial public offering (IPO). We will look to understand how this important corporate milestone impacts the company, investors and the other key stakeholders. We will then turn our attention to debt as a source of funding. We will focus on some of the main debt instruments that are available for borrowers and issuers and analyze this in the context of a leveraged buyout transaction. Finally, we will segue into private market equity. We will analyze how private market equity financing is often structured, using both early-stage businesses and more mature pre-IPO companies as the backdrop. There will be a number of hands-on elements involving the construction of Excel models and analyses throughout the course.",

Topics will include education, gendered social movements, men and women in the workplace, intimate relationships, family and sexuality (including LGBT), gender, science, technology and innovation, gendered violence and gender in the global economy. The focus of our discussions will be on gender in Hong Kong and China.",

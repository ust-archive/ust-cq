It will also give students an opportunity to discuss, through examples, how this evidence could be applied in the real world policy design. The questions to be addressed in this course focus on human capital development such as health, education, and labor policies over the course of one’s life. The examples will help students understand how to interpret available data and use it to evaluate different policy programs.",

According to the best research available (which we will read in this class), to be a successful and happy student leader, you need to understand happiness and manage to it - yours and others. Unfortunately, most leaders must learn this fact by hard experience. Furthermore, they are never exposed to the expanding science of happiness, which contains a wealth of information on how to be happier as a leader and make others happier as well.",

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

    "description": "How science, technology, and medicine work in the present can be illuminated by a study of their recent pasts. This course is an introduction to those modern histories, presented as a series of case studies. Students will come to understand how science, technology, and medicine are entangled with society and culture. The course will discuss topics such as the invention and innovation of the telephone; the attempt to predict earthquakes; how citizen science saved birds and humans from chemical poisoning; the modern survival of ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine; shifting ideas about robots; and how and why young people invented the personal computer, among others. By the end of the course, students will have a much clearer picture of how science, technology, and medicine are co-produced socially and culturally, and be able to apply those lessons to the world we live in now.",

Identification of the problem through interactions with the staff of the sponsored company. Ideation. Design concept generation. Selection of ideas. Prototyping. Testing and redesigning. In addition, students have to consider sustainability, manufacturability, and marketability of the proposed product solutions, which have to fulfill needs of the client under a budgetary constraint. Students are expected to spend less time on planning and idea generation as they have already gained these experiences in the second year but more time on prototyping and testing, as this project requires application and integration of more advance technologies and design.

    "description": "Disruption has its roots “out there” – in the external environment. Innovation and technology, geo[1]economic/political uncertainties, pandemics, war, supply chain disruptions, changing social, demographic, and regulatory challenges, etc. are shockwaves rippling across the globe with no short[1]term solution in sight. The exponential nature of these changes requires leaders to rethink and employ different approaches and skills. Organizations and leaders must be vigilant in transforming their mindset and behaviors to ensure agility, resilience, and successful execution of strategy. \n\nThis course focuses on the impact of such exponential disruptions through the lens of a diverse set of organizations through transformation journeys. These journeys include digitalization, international market expansion, make agile teams work, lead innovative projects, re-imagine customer relationships, implement ESG strategy, etc. – with the aim to identify and seize significant future-proofing opportunities. In addition, this course will cover industries such as banking/financial services, global industrials, family business, media and entertainment, social commerce and fast fashion, etc., in both global and Asian contexts. \n\nShould you choose to enroll, this course is highly valuable to those who may have a lingering feeling that changes/disruptions are accelerating exponentially, thus keeping abreast of these changes has become increasingly challenging. This course will provide mental frameworks, practical tools, and a platform for cross-learning in a VUCA environment where no one has all the answers – from where we may work together to discover useful ways, and perhaps silver linings, for our professional and leadership development.",

Very often the pollution source is either concealed or diffuse without an apparent point of discharge. The tracking of pollution source is essential to accurate assessment of the ecosystem and health consequences as well as effective mitigation and remedial actions. Pollution source tracking is a cross-disciplinary challenge, involving knowledge and skills in microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, hydrodynamics, etc. This course serves to provide an in-depth understanding of the principle of pollution source tracking, the cutting-edge technology in the field and also case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world.",

It will explore how to make cities more sustainable in terms of environmental, social, and economic aspects and equip students with the theoretical and methodological tools to draft and analyze strategies and their viability. The course will also introduce and evaluate various approaches to foster more sustainable and resilient forms of urbanization and urban life, such as localization, industrial symbiosis, and ecological restoration and review processes of reducing the dependence on external resources and increasing the local production and consumption of goods and services. These approaches will be examined in different contexts and scales, from local to global, and from individual to collective.",

    "description": "Why is poverty such an intractable problem in a world of unprecedented wealth? Why does global inequality keep increasing in most of the world, and why has this problem been ignored for such a long time? Why are some countries able to develop and others not? And perhaps most uncomfortably, is it possible to achieve universal progress on poverty, inequality, and development, or does progress necessarily mean that some people and countries fall behind as others advance in the current systemic configuration? In this course, we will draw on key theories of political economy and development as well as on long-standing debates in the history of development thought and practice to try and answer these and other related questions, and critically evaluate a wide range of mainstream and alternative development models and issues, and the complex politics behind them. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, as well as to anyone wanting to understand poverty, inequality, and development better and to make a difference.",

Communicating Public Policy is a hands-on workshop-based course that explores the entire spectrum of policy communication—from formal written documents to digital media strategies, public awareness campaigns, and oral presentations. Through rigorous analysis of global case studies and the creation of practical communication products, students will develop the technical skills, strategic thinking, and ethical understanding needed to engage diverse audiences in policy discourse. The course is structured around four key areas: the power and foundations of policy communications; written communications for various audiences; multimedia and digital communication strategies; and strategic approaches to policy communication including crisis response. This practice-oriented approach prepares students to become effective policy communicators capable of influencing public understanding and decision-making in increasingly complex information environments.",

We will delve into public market equity funding, notably the initial public offering (IPO). We will look to understand how this important corporate milestone impacts the company, investors and the other key stakeholders. We will then turn our attention to debt as a source of funding. We will focus on some of the main debt instruments that are available for borrowers and issuers and analyze this in the context of a leveraged buyout transaction. Finally, we will segue into private market equity. We will analyze how private market equity financing is often structured, using both early-stage businesses and more mature pre-IPO companies as the backdrop. There will be a number of hands-on elements involving the construction of Excel models and analyses throughout the course.",

That is, we will explore gender as the product of culture, groups and organizations and pay attention to behaviors and ways of thinking that are so taken-for-granted that we often fail to question them, with an eye to examining gender inequalities. Topics will include education, gendered social movements, men and women in the workplace, intimate relationships, family and sexuality (including LGBT), gender, science, technology and innovation, gendered violence and gender in the global economy. The focus of our discussions will be on gender in Hong Kong and China.",

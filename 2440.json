This course also discusses advanced general equilibrium models used in contemporary urban literature, including household sorting models, and quantitative spatial models. Students will learn basic tools for the visualization of spatial GIS data, and analytical tools for empirical evaluations of urban policies.",

Students in this course will be divided into design teams with a common goal: construct their project artifact or virtual 3D model, taken from a wide range of engineering and design contexts. There will be three main aspects: engineering skills, design/creativity, and teamwork. Fundamental engineering skills will be introduced in different engineering fields, such as 3D modelling or hands-on prototyping skills, along with exposure to various kinds of advanced technology available. Some class sessions will focus on design thinking and creativity. They are key to creating practical and interesting products. Students will work together in teams to realize their common idea of their final roadshow project, to have a real-world experience working with a design team.",

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

The course will discuss topics such as the invention and innovation of the telephone; the attempt to predict earthquakes; how citizen science saved birds and humans from chemical poisoning; the modern survival of ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine; shifting ideas about robots; and how and why young people invented the personal computer, among others.

    "description": "Disruption has its roots “out there” – in the external environment. Innovation and technology, geo[1]economic/political uncertainties, pandemics, war, supply chain disruptions, changing social, demographic, and regulatory challenges, etc. are shockwaves rippling across the globe with no short[1]term solution in sight. The exponential nature of these changes requires leaders to rethink and employ different approaches and skills. Organizations and leaders must be vigilant in transforming their mindset and behaviors to ensure agility, resilience, and successful execution of strategy. \n\nThis course focuses on the impact of such exponential disruptions through the lens of a diverse set of organizations through transformation journeys. These journeys include digitalization, international market expansion, make agile teams work, lead innovative projects, re-imagine customer relationships, implement ESG strategy, etc. – with the aim to identify and seize significant future-proofing opportunities. In addition, this course will cover industries such as banking/financial services, global industrials, family business, media and entertainment, social commerce and fast fashion, etc., in both global and Asian contexts. \n\nShould you choose to enroll, this course is highly valuable to those who may have a lingering feeling that changes/disruptions are accelerating exponentially, thus keeping abreast of these changes has become increasingly challenging. This course will provide mental frameworks, practical tools, and a platform for cross-learning in a VUCA environment where no one has all the answers – from where we may work together to discover useful ways, and perhaps silver linings, for our professional and leadership development.",

    "description": "The marine environment is susceptible to a range wide of land-based pollution such as sewage, industrial effluent and terrestrial runoff. Very often the pollution source is either concealed or diffuse without an apparent point of discharge. The tracking of pollution source is essential to accurate assessment of the ecosystem and health consequences as well as effective mitigation and remedial actions. Pollution source tracking is a cross-disciplinary challenge, involving knowledge and skills in microbiology, molecular biology, chemistry, hydrodynamics, etc. This course serves to provide an in-depth understanding of the principle of pollution source tracking, the cutting-edge technology in the field and also case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world.",

It will explore how to make cities more sustainable in terms of environmental, social, and economic aspects and equip students with the theoretical and methodological tools to draft and analyze strategies and their viability. The course will also introduce and evaluate various approaches to foster more sustainable and resilient forms of urbanization and urban life, such as localization, industrial symbiosis, and ecological restoration and review processes of reducing the dependence on external resources and increasing the local production and consumption of goods and services. These approaches will be examined in different contexts and scales, from local to global, and from individual to collective.",

    "description": "Why is poverty such an intractable problem in a world of unprecedented wealth? Why does global inequality keep increasing in most of the world, and why has this problem been ignored for such a long time? Why are some countries able to develop and others not? And perhaps most uncomfortably, is it possible to achieve universal progress on poverty, inequality, and development, or does progress necessarily mean that some people and countries fall behind as others advance in the current systemic configuration? In this course, we will draw on key theories of political economy and development as well as on long-standing debates in the history of development thought and practice to try and answer these and other related questions, and critically evaluate a wide range of mainstream and alternative development models and issues, and the complex politics behind them. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, as well as to anyone wanting to understand poverty, inequality, and development better and to make a difference.",

Faculty supervisors will work with students to reach out to the practitioners in the public sector. Students will apply what they have learnt in class to analyze and solve the problems in the real and dynamic society.

    "description": "The course is designed to provide a practical understanding of the key corporate financing solutions from both the issuers’ and investors’ perspectives. We will delve into public market equity funding, notably the initial public offering (IPO). We will look to understand how this important corporate milestone impacts the company, investors and the other key stakeholders. We will then turn our attention to debt as a source of funding. We will focus on some of the main debt instruments that are available for borrowers and issuers and analyze this in the context of a leveraged buyout transaction. Finally, we will segue into private market equity. We will analyze how private market equity financing is often structured, using both early-stage businesses and more mature pre-IPO companies as the backdrop. There will be a number of hands-on elements involving the construction of Excel models and analyses throughout the course.",

    "description": "This is the final course of the four-course Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) series, which allows students to engage in faculty-led research projects that can span up to four terms. Successful completion of UROP 3100 or UROP 3200 is a prerequisite for proceeding to UROP 4100, which can involve either the same or a different project led by the same faculty supervisor. Progression from UROP 1100 to UROP 4100, regardless of whether it is on the same or a different research project, must be under the guidance of the same faculty supervisor. In case of a change in faculty supervisor, students need to restart from UROP 1100. Approval by faculty supervisor(s) is required. Students are required to submit a written report upon completion of the course. Graded P or F.",

It is used extensively in civil and environmental engineering for site investigation, resource exploration, urban growth monitoring, detection of natural hazards (e.g., landslides, floods, earthquakes, etc) and other applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is critically needed to extract meaningful information from the vast amounts of diverse datasets generated by satellite remote sensing. This course introduces applications of AI in remote sensing. It covers the principles underlying remote sensing, various remote sensing technologies, satellite data preparation for AI analysis, and common AI techniques for remote sensing research and applications in civil and environmental engineering.",

The course starts with an extensive review of statistics, the difference between ML and descriptive statistics, discusses sampling approaches for uncertainty quantification, then covers the fundamental knowledge of supervised learning (Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian processes, deep neural networks), unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixtures), and state space models (Kalman, particle filters). The course will further emphasize on the proper use of ML for civil engineering applications, including incorporating physics-based knowledge (physics-informed ML), dealing with data acquisition challenges (design of experiment, global optimization), and so on. Students will learn to address some unique challenges of applying ML to real-world engineering applications, preparing themselves better in their future career.",

    "description": "The course will be offered as an 2-credit course in the Spring semester. Students who have passed COMP2633 and have gotten the instructor consent can join this course, they will be working together based on the knowledge they have learned from COMP2633 and this course, forming teams to further investigate various advanced topics related to the more practical side of cybersecurity. They will then join the various cybersecurity competitions. The students will get 2 credits for successfully completing this course. Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving. Instructor's approval is required.",

    "description": "Compiler implementation techniques are relevant to a wide array of software engineering areas. From parsing ad-hoc configuration file formats to validating complex specification languages to generating efficient code solving data-intensive problems at scale, many important problems of today and tomorrow require knowledge of basic compiler technology. The course exposes students to the essentials of modern compiler construction, including parsing, semantic analysis, program transformation, and code generation. Students will learn to design and implement their own programming language and extend it with a feature of their choice in a small team project. The course focuses on achieving these goals through effective high-level programming techniques, whose mastery will also make students a better programmer in general.",

    "description": "This course will expose students to new and practical issues of real world mining and managing big data. Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment.",

Understanding how distributed systems function is crucial for developing resilient, scalable solutions in an interconnected world. The Distributed Systems course begins by defining distributed systems and exploring prominent architectures deployed today, such as client-server and peer-to-peer models. It then delves into fundamental concepts, including clock synchronization protocols, logical clocks, coordination and agreement protocols, and consensus algorithms, such as Paxos and Raft. Later topics include replication techniques, peer-to-peer systems, and blockchain technology, all of which are essential to modern distributed applications. Students will also engage in hands-on projects that involve the incremental development, deployment, and performance evaluation of a simplified but significant distributed system, providing practical experience that complements theoretical learning.",

Thus, the computation in the training or inference of the foundation model could be one of the most important workflows running on top of modern computer systems. This course unravels the secrets of the efficient deployment of such workflows from the system perspective. Specifically, we will i) explain how a modern machine learning system (i.e., PyTorch) works; ii) understand the performance bottleneck of machine learning computation over modern hardware (e.g., Nvidia GPUs); iii) discuss four main parallel strategies in foundation model training (data-, pipeline-, tensor model-, optimizer- parallelism); iv) real-world deployment of foundation model including efficient inference and fine-tuning.",

The relevant foundation models form the basis of state-of-art systems and become ubiquitous in solving a wide range of generative tasks in computer vision, for instance. With the unprecedented potential capabilities, these models also give rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. This course aims to cover state-of-the-art research topics, starting with technical foundations (BERT, GPT, T5 models, mixture-of-expert models, retrieval-based models), emerging capabilities (knowledge, reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning), fine-tuning and adaptation, system design, as well as security and ethics. We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to routinely read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end. This is an advanced graduate course and all the students are expected to have taken machine learning and preferably NLP courses before and are familiar with deep learning models such as Transformers.",

The course starts by introducing key macro variables that measure aggregate economic performance. The relationship among these key variables will then be studied in the goods, money, and labor markets in closed and open economies. The theoretical framework presented in this course will enable non-SBM students to predict and analyze the impacts of government fiscal and monetary policies on the economy.",

This suggests that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze housing. Besides, many households use mortgage loan to finance home purchase. A substantial collapse in house price might lead to negative equity for leveraged households and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. This course studies both the microeconomic and macroeconomic issues of housing. Topics include housing demand and supply analysis, equilibrium models of housing market, rationales and effects of public policies on housing, causes and consequences of housing market dynamics and crisis. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed.",

The focus will be on the economic analysis and valuation of firms, with the underlying goal of achieving a comprehensive understanding of each firm. The course will begin with an exploration of industry and market trends, followed by a systematic development of valuation techniques from the ground up, along with an examination of the limitations of current standard valuation methods. These techniques and the developed framework will be applied to study specific companies. Finally, the course will address portfolio construction and issues related to portfolio management.",

It aims to equip business leaders and strategists to understand and interpret econometric analysis in business strategy analysis, and to provide them with an understanding of three widely used techniques in modern business econometrics: randomized control trials, regression discontinuity, and differences-in-differences. Data analysis in economics, or “econometrics” as it is called by practitioners, has moved away from mathematical complexity and towards simpler tools that are accessible to businesses and can be applied easily to big data. After learning how these tools provide superior analytical results than traditional regression techniques in making inferences about the real world, business strategists will gain the practical knowledge to wield them successfully and make better business strategy decisions with real business data.",

In this course, students will learn how to solve various models analytically using dynamic programming and sequential methods. Key topics in monetary policy (or monetary economics) such as money neutrality, super money neutrality, the Fisher equation, Friedman rule, equilibrium determinacy, time inconsistency and reputation in monetary policy are also explored in this course. Numerical solution techniques are emphasized with calibration and simulation methods taught using Matlab, Octave and Dynare, to compute the quantitative impact of economic shocks and policy events. Bonus computing workshops will be provided.  Applications to policy and real-world phenomena are emphasized throughout.",

    "description": "This course presents a modern introduction to international finance and open economy macroeconomics based on a micro-founded, dynamic general equilibrium approach. The first 4-5 weeks provide coverage of basic international finance topics including global imbalances, current account sustainability, theories to explain the current account, determinants of real exchange rates, and international capital integration. These foundation concepts, together with the knowledge you have gained in ECON 5140 are used to develop an understanding of modern graduate-level open economy macroeconomics. We will study international business cycles in data and models with increasing levels of sophistication including the open economy real business cycle model. Students will not only learn how to solve various models analytically using pen and paper but also through using numerical solution techniques in Matlab, Octave, and DYNARE, to compute the quantitative impact of economic shocks and policy events. Bonus computing workshops will be provided. Applications to policy and real-world phenomena are emphasized throughout. Assumed knowledge is ECON 5140.",

The bulk of the course focuses on learning the foundations of these technologies and methods to develop IT applications to implement them. Starting with the basics of internet communication and security, we shall see how they apply to applications such as search, demand forecasting, and customer acquisition. The students will learn how to develop simple programs (in python) covering important techniques such as graph search, data processing and visualization via dimension reduction, regression, clustering and classification. Case studies will be used to introduce the real-world application of these tools.",

    "description": "This course is designed to give students with little or no technical background a general understanding about robots and their potential impact. Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day‐to‐day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour‐based, cognitive and biologically-inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human‐machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. The learning process is designed to transcend conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and will be facilitated by a series of demonstrative sessions presenting students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions enabled by robotic and automation technology. In this exploration process, students will be encouraged to apply their personal background and interests, and possibly experiment with robot kits.",

Through hands on work with a simple but fully functional wireless communication system, you will understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these systems.  This course is centered on weekly laboratories, each designed to introduce an important concept in the design of these systems.  The lab sessions are supported by two one-hour lectures and a tutorial that introduce the concepts for the next laboratory, as well as reviewing and expanding the concepts learned in the previous laboratory.",

    "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

These applications include rendering, 3D object manipulation, augmented reality, and human-AI interaction. With the increasing demand for processing and analyzing such 3D data, there has been significant progress in developing novel technologies, particularly those based on deep learning. This course will explore recent advances in machine learning techniques for 3D data and discuss the remaining challenges. The course will cover basic and advanced machine learning techniques, such as representation learning, neural radiance field, and diffusion model, for 3D data management, rendering, analysis, and generation. The course will be project-oriented, with no exams, but will include manageable programming tasks. It will combine pedagogical lectures, seminar-style reading group presentations, and interactive discussions.",

    "description": "Originated from Stanford University’s Life Design Lab (Bill Burnett and Dave Evans), this course employs a method called “design thinking” to help students from any program develop a constructive and effective approach to finding and designing their vocation after university. Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F.",

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

Called environmental risks, they can affect human health, economic development, and social stability in significant ways. Therefore, it is crucial to use scientific methods, tools, and frameworks to assess and manage these risks effectively. In this course, students will learn the concepts, principles, and methods of environmental risk assessment and management. They will also learn how to identify, quantify, assess, mitigate, and disclose environmental risks and opportunities in environmental policies, projects, or actions. Students will explore the causes, impacts, and responses of different types of environmental risks. They will also consider how these risks intersect with social justice issues, and how they can challenge and transform the power structures and inequalities that underlie environmental challenges. Finally, students will apply their knowledge and skills to real-world case studies, using various tools and frameworks, as well as understand the importance of transparent environmental risk reporting in corporate finance.",

This course will also study the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the link between financial and real sectors.

Although the range of sophistication in people associated with alternative investments varies substantially, it is more and more common to use them in investment strategies, either as direct investments or through funds of funds or structured products.  The purpose of this course is to give participants a good understanding and workable knowledge of the techniques that should be part of the tool kit of anyone investing in, analyzing and/or advising private and institutional clients on the inclusion of alternative investments - and more specifically hedge funds - in their portfolios.  Furthermore, this course will enable the participants to absorb the analytical arguments in the technical publications - the in-house research notes of financial institutions and in practitioner oriented journal - that deal with alternative investments and to apply them.",

The course provides theoretical and empirical findings that illustrate that financial decisions need to incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors to ensure long-term financial success of firms. The course also covers new trends, such as U.S. political polarization and the important role of China in establishing a global leadership role in green finance, which may impact how corporations are becoming more responsible.",

In order to support and grow the structured product business, a variety of functions or roles are developed in the financial industry, including traders, quants, structurers, and sales, etc. at investment banks or relationship managers and product specialists at private banks. As a result, all the financial practitioners are assumed to have basic and practical knowledge about structured products. This course is designed for students who are pursuing front-office careers at investment banks, private banks, or asset management companies. It covers basic concepts of structured products, introduces popular products in the market (e.g., principal protected notes and equity-linked notes), and discusses the landscape of product manufacturing and distribution process. It focuses on applications rather than theory by illustrating real-world examples as well as their practical implementations in the industry.",

    "description": "Over the past several decades, the field of finance has developed a successful paradigm based on the notions that investors and managers were generally rational and the prices of securities were generally “efficient”.  In recent years, however, anecdotal evidence as well as theoretical and empirical research has shown this paradigm to be insufficient to describe various features of actual financial markets.  In this course we will use psychology and more realistic settings to guide and develop alternative theories of financial markets. We will examine how the insights of behavioral finance complement the traditional paradigm and shed light on investors' trading patterns, the behavior of asset prices, corporate finance, and various Wall Street institutions and practices. In particular, we will discuss how behavioral biases leads to stock return predictability and thus cross-sectional trading strategies.",

Climate and transition finance (investments in systems, companies and projects that sequester carbon, avoid emissions and fund renewable energy) and the creation of new financial instruments that price carbon emissions – is a critical part of this required transformation of the global economy. This course will explore the financial tools that can be used to mitigate the impacts of climate change and accelerate the sequestration and capture of carbon. Focus areas are: capital markets and exchanges, emissions trading systems, investments in low emissions technologies, project finance for nature-based climate solutions, renewable energy and other project types, corporate finance of decarbonization, carbon credits/offsets, and related regulatory changes.",

The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

    "description": "Languages are considered complex repositories of cultures, where meanings are created and articulated, verbally and non-verbally, about the artefacts, norms, beliefs, and values of cultures. Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

As the world’s oldest chess game, Weiqi is speculated to start around the 23rd century BC and be created by Emperor Yao. This course will cover the fundamental techniques of capturing stones, common life-and-death shapes, basic joseki, and opening theory in Weiqi, as well as how to complete a full game against an opponent. By participating in this Weiqi course, students can gain insights into the origin and development trajectory of Weiqi culture, stories of prominent figures, and its implications on artificial intelligence (AI), one of the hottest topics today. Weiqi is more than a game and a cultural carrier. It is hoped that Weiqi will become one of students’ lifelong hobbies.",

The course also aims to raise awareness of how language is used to create and maintain power through narratives of identity. Case studies will be presented, with a view to deconstructionist analysis on the role of language in producing and reproducing ostensibly stable ‘identities’ along binary lines such as masculine/feminine, Western/Asian and straight/queer. The course also investigates how humans perform other types of social difference and belonging such as ethnicity and social class.",

Given its sweeping impact worldwide, we can no longer dismiss it as mere pop culture and entertainment. Indeed, anime has gradually emerged as a new field of research, dominating film histories and theories in the academia. This course offers an overview of anime by examining its histories, techniques and technologies, medium, genres, and conceptual issues. It will track anime’s early years, development, industrialization, globalization, and explosive boom in the digital age. Focusing on cinema features and TV series, this course will explore a variety of overlapping (sub)genres, such as Robot, Mecha, Cyberpunk, Apocalypse, Adventure, Supernatural, Shōjo, and Tragedy. Conceptual issues like cuteness, gender, sexuality, race, nation, environment, human-machine interaction, AI and posthumanism will be examined closely. Japanese language and knowledge are welcome but not required for this course.",

    "name": "Global History: New Anthropological Perspectives",
    "description": "This course takes on the broad sweep of human history from an anthropological perspective, highlighting the great social and cultural diversity of human experience. Popular accounts of global history depict human society evolving stepwise in a unilinear fashion: egalitarian hunter-gatherers gave way to hierarchical agricultural societies before the rise of cities and, later, the establishment of states. New archaeological and anthropological discoveries are now challenging such picture: the trajectory of human history, it turns out, has been much more diverse and unpredictable than previously imagined. The course will delve into anthropological phenomena that showcase this diversity, such as hunter-gatherers’ seasonality, ‘play agriculture’ in Amazonia, egalitarian cities, urban revolutions in Mesoamerica, or stranger-kings across the Pacific. These case studies, analyzed through modern anthropological theory, reveal the profound role of collective intentionality in shaping our history. They cast light on the past while also providing insights into the possibilities of the future.",

    "description": "This course develops students’ craft, creativity and technical skills in working with live electronics in the production of sound. Using significant repertoire as points of reference, the course explores techniques for using software to manipulate and create sound in contexts such as live instrumental performance (including combinations of acoustic instrument plus electronics), sound installation, and sound sculpture. The course will culminate in an open concert presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester in consultation with the instructor. Approval of the course instructor is needed for students to enroll in this course. Students should have prior experience with electronic music. Prior experience with instrumental composition will also be beneficial.",

This course explores various theoretical issues in animation studies, such as movement, stasis, affect, automation and agency, TV serialization, digitality, media mix, sound, authorship and spectatorship, animals, race, gender, cuteness, animism and environment. Animated films made in China, Japan, and other parts of the world will be analyzed as case studies.",

    "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

Research on existing solutions and how to conduct the stakeholder and market analyses will be taught for designing the needs screening matrix in needs selection. Students are going to unlock their creativity potentials through the in-class activities.The new ideas of addressing the unmet needs are generated in which the ideas are grouped ad organized into a concept map. To translate a promising concept from an idea into a rudimentary design, the concept exploration is facilitated by prototyping. The prototypes are tested by the potential users. This course aims to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, analytical, design and project management skills.",

Students learn about fundamental design theories, principles, and methods through a project-based learning approach. Students then experience several stages of a creative design process. The process begins by asking students to identify real-world problems through social, business, scientific, and technological perspectives. To add specificity, students will be able to describe the behaviors and needs of social interactions, observe demographic phenomena, assess business viability, and identify and understand technological changes and impacts, etc. After defining a problem statement, students will be guided to generate creative solutions using brainstorming tools and creative thinking skills. Selected solutions will be presented in form of prototypes and open for user feedback. This course emphasizes the appreciation of the role and significance of design for our society.",

They include, Interaction Design (IxD) studying how to form a structure for users to act and react to the products, services or systems; User Experience Design (UX) exploring how to enhance a positive feeling for users while interacting; User Interface Design (UI) enhancing the experience through better design of the interface elements. Finally, the course will consider broader aspects of Interaction Design, including interfacing the workflow with other teams, privacy, and dark patterns. Students will design an interactive application from the initial ideation to usability testing.",

Unlike traditional product markets, a salient feature of these industries is that services are often intangible and not storable, and often high variable, which raises significant challenges in decision making. The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This course will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations. Students will also have the opportunity to apply these concepts in various service industries by conducting a group project.",

Unlike traditional product markets, a salient feature of these industries is that services are intangible and not storable, and often highly variable, which raises significant challenges in decision making. The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This class will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations.",

We have seen the founder who has started four businesses in 15 years and brought the company he created to an IPO three times, bringing back incredible wealth for himself, his investors and his company team. Examples like these show that there is a trajectory of success for a company from Idea at the time of founding to an IPO, although with a very high demise rate. On this path, founders, management teams and investors are required to choose the mode of mutual fulfillment and code of conduct of compromise and mutual tolerance while playing for their own interests in order to follow the right trajectory.",

The course introduces students to the research skills for finding and evaluating sources for discipline-related writing and speaking tasks. Students are expected to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas from different sources when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students' competence in communicating effectively in a wider community beyond the university, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member and leader of a group. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

The course introduces students to the research skills for finding and evaluating sources for discipline-related writing and speaking tasks. Students are expected to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas from different sources when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students' competence in communicating effectively in a wider community beyond the university, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member and leader of a group. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

    "description": "This course offers students the language and communication skills and strategies to adapt their writing to any professional contexts. It increases student awareness of how writing creates change and convinces one to take action, and how audiences, contexts and genre call for different choices in language, organization, format and style. As students explore and analyze business genres, they learn how to shape and adapt their language skills, strategies and communication practices to meet the needs of various internal and external audiences including co-workers, supervisors, management and customers. The course also develops in students the ability to communicate in digital contexts by analyzing and producing texts including on email and social media. Students will develop a repertoire of language and communication skills and strategies and will write for various workplace needs. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

Students will also develop ways to express themselves in multimodal settings. The course develops in students particularly with soft skills to handle sensitive business situations and incidents including a crisis, and how to communicate interculturally in diverse settings. Students will develop a repertoire of language and communication skills and strategies to meet various workplace needs. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

    "description": "This course empowers students to confidently tackle complex academic writing challenges in research project writing regardless of major. Students will understand the varied needs, purposes, expectations and contexts of their writing tasks. By exploring conventions that are discipline-specific and common across disciplines, students learn to adapt their writing effectively. The course also emphasizes taking a stance and creating strong, coherent, evidence-backed arguments. With advanced synthesis, citation strategies and rhetorical techniques, students position their ideas and solve problems critically through their writing. Exposing students to technologies particularly Gen AI tools for research and customized chatbots to guide writing, this course creates writers who are adept at integrating technologies while maintaining academic integrity. Through collaboration, reflection and the writing process, the course nurtures a community of writers who value peer feedback, self-evaluation and continuous improvement. Students embarking on their final year project will find this course highly useful.",

    "description": "This course offers students advanced strategies and practice in writing texts in their academic disciplines. It increases student awareness of how disciplinary conventions, genre and rhetorical situations call for different choices in language, organization, format, citation and style. As students explore and analyze academic disciplinary genres and their research and writing process they learn how to use advanced language skills and strategies including developing stances, defining, explaining, reporting, analyzing, synthesizing and organizing and how to repurpose academic content to communicate ideas effectively. The course also develops in students the view of writing as a social process as they work with a community of writers who share ideas, give feedback and support. It creates writers who are engaged to demonstrate their writing in various ways including a small-scale research project. The course threads competencies in communication, problem-solving and personal development including lifelong learning and awareness to help students develop transferable skills to become effective writers in their academic disciplines. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

In addition, mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been successfully developed, making RNAs more exciting and crucial material to learn. The success of making mRNA vaccines encourages scientists to develop mRNA-based drugs to treat different diseases in the future. This experiential learning course focuses on applying several essential RNA-related technologies in diagnosing and treating human diseases. The course introduces the basic knowledge of RNAs, fundamental principles on RNA-related technologies, and experimental practices for RNA technologies. After learning the basics of RNAs and the principles of six RNA technologies, students will work in teams to develop their projects, and design experiments to make their RNA-related products. By the end of the course, each team will conduct experiments, collect the data, and present and discuss their results at the end of the course. For LIFS/BIBU students in their third or fourth year of study and students with instructor’s consent only.",

Registration of pharmaceutical products (drugs, medical devices, food supplements) is a comparatively new biotechnology‐business model, which has evolved from governmental regulations to public health through the assurance of safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. This course emphasizes the essential components of pharmaceutical development; discusses the key stages and decision points in the process; and gives a detailed analysis on the quality control and regulatory requirements. The technological and financial requirements of the development of pharmaceutical products are also covered. Professional training in these disciplines, lacking in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, is crucial for students who plan to pursue further studies or develop their career in the biotechnology sectors.",

The course's aim is to broaden the professional and engineering interests of students by enhancing their practicum/team-based experience through initiatives different from those of traditional lectures and tutorials. The training is project-based to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project.",

In this experiential course, a number of labs have been prepared with a different focus on orbits dynamics, analysis of control and thermal subsystems. Every student should finish fundamental labs individually, and organize in groups to work on an advanced design topic. The course shall offer students with both hands-on experience software simulation and hardware implementation. The topics in this course are introduced with mathematical derivations and case studies. After taking this course, students are expected to acquire an understanding of  the fundamentals of satellite engineering and more importantly a common sense in technical and managerial aspects of engineering design projects with focus on aerospace applications.",

    "description": "What business can generate long-term profit? What is the most important topic in this era? What are the most critical challenges to our human society? All these go to sustainability. From the inception of the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s to the ambitious goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, the need for sustainable practices has become increasingly apparent. The rise of solar power, the surge in popularity of electric cars, and the debates surrounding genetically modified food are all indicative of the complex and interrelated issues we face today. Extreme weather events and the ever-pressing threat of climate change further compound the urgency of our situation. As an engineer, your role extends beyond acquiring strong technical knowledge and skills. It necessitates an acute awareness of the urgent social, political, and environmental needs that shape our world. This course aims to equip you with the necessary tools to address these challenges. We will introduce and elucidate the fundamental design concepts, methods, tools, and technologies associated with lean and green manufacturing systems, supply chains, and green energy. It will also encompass the evaluation, design, and maintenance of environmentally friendly products, processes, services, and policies. Note that knowledge of Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering is also a requirement outlined by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) accreditation criteria.",

Whether it is about resolving technology issues at financial services companies or addressing financial or regulatory issues confronting technology firms, this course will put students in the manager’s or protagonist’s role in gathering and analyzing information before ultimately making decisions. We begin with case studies at traditional financial firms before evolving to more non-traditional firms. The financial or regulatory issues challenging technology companies, and the emerging categories of digital assets like crypto currencies in the context of alternative strategy in investment management will also be investigated and studied.",

    "description": "In order to help the students better understand the causes and consequences of the economic development in contemporary China, this course examines this phenomenon from both historical and comparative perspectives. The course starts by reviewing the formation of a vibrant market economy in China from 1700 onward and introduce progress made in the studies of Chinese economic history. This historical background is important to view the socio-economic characteristics of the pre-1949 Chinese society and their relevance to modern economic growth. This course also exposes the students to the basic concepts and analytic tools in political economy such as market economy, the state, conflict of interests, correlation and causality, and selection bias. This illustrates the importance of causal explanations in social scientific inquiry.",

Employing guest speakers, lectures, cases, contemporary readings, role-plays, fieldwork, reflective student writing, and discussion groups, the course engages students in a serious consideration of their own ethical standards as applied to their present academic environment and their future careers. Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions.

    "description": "This course will focus on specific CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) issues facing companies today. Along with changing attitudes, new global regulatory CSR requirements are increasingly putting firms under pressure to demonstrate positive social and environmental impacts, while maintaining their commitments to investors. Students will investigate how actual firms are managing these pressures while continuing to address the needs of their stakeholders. Incorporating aspects of the benchmark standards such as the GRI and various ESG (Environmental Social Governance) initiatives will help students to strengthen their own knowledge, skill, and attitudes in this area. The course has an embedded project, with direct links to one or more businesses, which will give students the necessary practical grounding for effectively understanding the challenges of CSR in the contemporary business environment.",

    "description": "This is a course about working effectively with clients. Strong analytical skills and business knowledge are foundational to making an impact, but not enough on their own. Influencing others also requires productive working relationships. This course is designed for full-time MBA students who may spend part of their careers in roles where they will advise clients: consultants (including “in-house”), investment bankers, client relationship managers, etc. The lessons can also be applied to a range of other business relationships you will need (with supervisors, colleagues, direct reports, JV partners, etc.). You may also hire advisors in the future. Understanding the principles of effective advisory relationships can help you choose the right advisors and establish productive relationships. The course will primarily focus on the ‘day-to-day’ client relationship practices that will help establish you as a competent professional, a trusted advisor, and an influential change leader. As a secondary benefit, you will gain an appreciation for how high performing professional service firms operate. To maximize your learning, we will identify specific ways you can put these insights to work during internships or your first job after graduation. Graded P or F.",

    "description": "This elective course focuses on the essence of innovation – something that entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship have in common regardless whether it takes place in a startup, a large corporation, or a family business. It centers on an experiential learning program that will require students to develop and pitch an innovation-oriented project. Depending on the student’s career and life goals, this project may consist of a business plan for a startup, a project proposal for their corporate employers, or a new business line for their family businesses. At the end of the course, students will pitch their proposals to a panel of successful innovators whose careers spanned across intrapreneurship, entrepreneurship, and venture capital. Throughout the process, students will experience personal self-discovery and learn about practical tools for pursuing a career in innovation. The course is taught by two instructors: an academic turned entrepreneur and a product manager who began as an intrapreneur before becoming an entrepreneur and later, a venture capitalist.",

The first part of the course focuses on individual bi/multilingualism. It will examine the basics of how bi/multilingualism is defined and measured, types of bi/multilingualism, and bi/multilingual language behaviors. The second part of the course explores foundations of bi/multilingual language education. Topics include second language versus bilingual acquisition, bilingualism and cognition, and bilingual education for bilingualism and biliteracy. The third part of the course focuses on pedagogical issues and practices in bi/multilingual language education. We will discuss the uses and roles of translation in language teaching, translanguaging in pedagogy, and mixed code and classroom code-switching, with special attention given to the teaching of Chinese and English in the context of Hong Kong.

This course also offers a critical survey of important issues related to Chinese script in modern times, including simplification, Romanization (Latinization), recognition, and adaptability to various Sinitic and Sinosphere languages, taking into consideration research in general linguistics, sociolinguistics, and heritage history.

It comprises 2 parts: Part 1 aims to equip all full-time research postgraduate (RPg) students with basic teaching skills before assuming teaching assistant duties for the department. Good teaching skills can be acquired through learning and practice.  This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course. MPhil students are required to give at least one 30-minute session of instructional delivery in front of a group of students for one term. PhD students are required to give at least one such session each in two different terms. Graded PP, P or F.",

In recent years, quantum information processing (QIP) has emerged as one of the “most fiercely competitive in today’s world of technology”. This course offers an introduction to the past, present and future of QIP. The theme is to explain the major ideas and issues in QIP, and how this new technology will change our understanding of information processing. The course starts from a gentle introduction to quantum theory without assuming any physics background, then moves to the key applications of QIP including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. Besides theory, demonstrations and hands-on experiences with quantum hardware will also be given. Students will benefit from learning quantum information technology in an interdisciplinary environment, with knowledge and skills for comprehending the fast-paced developments in today’s technological world.",

The pre-crisis faith that free markets produce optimal outcomes has been significantly eroded. A decade on, global policymakers still struggle to engage with a more empirically-grounded and less dogmatic brand of economics, and the differing prescriptions that it might suggest. Students of economics need to have an overview of the causes and consequences of the crisis, the ideas that contributed to it, and how those ideas and their policy implications are being challenged and debated. Most importantly, students of public policy need to be able to understand what went wrong – both in economics, and in policy.",

At the same time, the pandemic has raised doubts about the prospects of emerging markets.

Using growth diagnostics, this course examines the economic prospects of the key emerging markets in Asia – China, India, the ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), draws lessons for development policy, and examines the implications for emerging markets in a pandemic-disrupted world.",

    "description": "Singapore is often held up by policy scholars as a model of sound, rational, technocratic policymaking in which the relatively low level of democratic freedoms has not held back (and may even have contributed to) the city-state’s success. Like Hong Kong, it is also a global financial center, taxes wealth and income lightly, and embraces free trade and flexible markets. At the same time, the Singapore state is far more intrusive and paternalistic in certain policy domains, e.g. public housing, retirement financing, economic planning, and public sector ownership of businesses. These similarities and contrasts between Singapore and Hong Kong reveal both cities’ governing philosophies and provide insights into how history and context shape policy and outcomes. This course will include a four-day study trip to Singapore.",

    "description": "Rapid advances in disruptive technologies over the last two decades have significantly altered our lives. They have upended old business models, disintermediated incumbent firms in many industries, and disrupted supply chains. This module gives students a broad introduction to the key disruptive technologies that are likely to transform our economy and society in the next decade or so. We will examine the practical applications of these technologies and discuss their policy implications and socioeconomic impacts. We will also look at the potential for governments to leverage new digital technologies to deliver new services or improve existing ones and enhance public value. Above all, we will examine the implications for public policy and how government should respond.",

How are projects and programs recommended, approved, implemented, monitored, and independently evaluated in an MDB (Multilateral Development Bank)? How results orientation is emphasized at ADB in achieving better quality projects and programs? And how institutional reforms take place at MDBs such as ADB which ensure improved staff resource reallocation and skills-mix changes in meeting evolving operational needs with efficiency and effectiveness?

    "description": "The impact of climate change on humanity and ecosystems is broader and more severe than anticipated. Urgent and systemic transitions are required to ensure a future with net zero emissions and climate resilience, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, achieving climate goals faces significant challenges, one of most important being the investment gap. First, existing funding flows fall far below the required scale for the future. Second, the growth momentum of the private sector remains insufficient. Third, limitations in fund allocation result in inadequate support for the most vulnerable sectors, industries and groups of population, with over 90% of funds directed toward climate mitigation and less than 10% toward adaptation. In short, accelerating climate action is only feasible with a several-fold increase in financing. The first part of this course introduces students to the foundations of green and sustainable finance, such as its definition, markets and instruments. The second part of this course follows the CFA Institute’s Certificate in ESG Investing curriculum to make sure that the students are equipped with the most up to date information on green and sustainable finance. At the end of the semester, students should have a strong background to be able to study for the certification, which will give them a cutting edge when applying for jobs related to ESG and sustainability.",

    "name": "The Rise, Fall, and Contemporary Resurgence of the East Asian Developmental State Model",
    "description": "The East Asian developmental state model represents a unique blend of state-led macroeconomic planning, heavily interventionist industrial policies, severe labor suppression, and capitalist markets. Despite intermittent financial crises, cronyism, and corruption, it has been credited with producing the most impressive economic growth miracles of the 20th century, including but not limited to that of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and even Mainland China since Deng Xiaoping’s experiments with reform and opening up, leading many experts and policymakers to refer to the region as the “growth driver” and “anchor of stability” of the global economy. The model has dominated the political and economic landscape of East Asia from the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, when the rise of neoliberalism gradually shrunk the policy space for state intervention, and successive waves of democratization, as incomplete and flawed as they sometimes were, placed limits on the severity of labor suppression, putting in question the continued feasibility and even desirability of the model. However, in the 21st century, at least three major developments have resulted in the contemporary resurgence of the East Asian developmental state model, albeit in an evolved form: (1) greater acceptance and even demand for increased state intervention following neoliberalism’s retreat in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; (2) increased protectionism as an integral part of the new Cold War race for technological supremacy between the United States and Mainland China (especially in terms of advanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence); and (3) the deglobalization and regionalization of value chains following the Covid-19 pandemic. In this course, we will analyze the historical and contemporary application of the East Asian developmental state model in a wide variety of political and economic contexts, its merits and demerits in these contexts, and its potential to further evolve and adapt to new geopolitical and geoeconomic realities. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on state-market relations, industrial and labor policies, and technological upgrading.",

    "description": "As one of the earliest concerns of moral and political discourse, corruption has long blighted human affairs, and it represents one of the most serious global threats of our time. Its effects are wide-ranging, with corruption having been found to distort human judgment, warp the organizational cultures of governmental and business institutions, undermine economic and political development, increase poverty, compromise human rights, corrode the integrity of economic and political systems, cause extreme inequalities, destroy public confidence in governments and markets, and undercut environmental protection and climate change policies. In this course, we will connect theory with practice to identify the causes and consequences of public and private sector corruption in different policy areas and contexts, and analyze the effectiveness of a wide variety of responses, measures, and strategies designed to prevent and combat it. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on ethics and integrity, good governance, and the role of modern technologies in both facilitating and fighting corruption.",

Tomorrow’s employees and executives may not need the advanced skills of a data scientist, but they must be data literate. Therefore, there is a need to bring together data skills and business management by introducing a common core course, specializing at applying data analytics techniques to business scenarios for the implementation of business intelligence. The aim of this course is to introduce the general workflow of business intelligence and various applications of data analytics models in business scenarios. The course also focuses on an analysis of the strengths, limitations, causes and benefits of the use of business intelligence. The course also includes hands-on practical exercises by using data mining and statistics models on real business data sets.",

    "description": "Originated from Stanford University’s Life Design Lab (Bill Burnett and Dave Evans), this course employs a method called “design thinking” to help students from any program develop a constructive and effective approach to finding and designing their vocation after university. Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of your life. We also touch on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout your life. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following your HKUST graduation. For Science students only. Graded P or F.",

Co-taught by lecturers from chemistry and life science, respectively, approximately one half of the course deals with an introduction into the chemical universe that makes life possible; simple sugars and complex carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides and proteins, DNA, RNA and lipids. Interactions and laws governing these substances and ways we can observe what they are doing are covered. The other half of the course is about how these compounds are involved in some of the basic mechanisms of life; from the functions and evolution of membranes to cells all the way up to humans and other organisms; areas covered include genetics and genomics, diseases, food and health, and biotechnology.",

This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of this course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and  descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn from real-world data. Upon completion of this course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as better understanding of social science research.

It will discuss the normative foundations of democracy, the relationship between individual rights and rule by majority; the procedural and substantive aspects of democracy, and how to conceptualize the common good or public interest in democracy. It encourages students to apply the knowledge of democracy learnt in class to critically evaluate existing political systems and diverse social issues that they face in everyday life. Through in-depth examination of democracy as a normative value, this course will also encourage students to reflect the implications of democracy as a theory to various practical socio-political issues in today’s world.",

The new digital data have in turn led to the rise of Computational Social Science, an emerging field that aims to empirically study social behavior by applying computational methods, algorithms, and models on \"big data\". This course introduces the methods and ideas of computational social sciences. The course consists of lectures, projects and tutorials. Students will learn and evaluate the new possibilities and challenges that digital data have created for studying social phenomena. Students will also learn and practice essential methods that are needed to analyze digital data, from data collection to techniques and methods to analyze big data.",

    "description": "Inventive ideas are the result of extensive research and development by scientists and engineers, often leading to groundbreaking products, services, or platforms with the potential to revolutionize industries. However, transforming these innovative concepts into commercially viable ventures is a complex process that requires navigating various challenges. This course guides students through the journey of commercializing inventive ideas, from initial concept to market entry. Students will explore the critical steps in bringing inventions to market, starting with identifying product-market fit and developing comprehensive commercialization strategies and business plan. The course covers essential aspects such as identifying target markets, analyzing competition, estimating market size, and strategizing customer acquisition and sales channels. This course collaborate with the Office of Knowledge Transfer (OKT) and students will work on recommended HKUST’s Deep Tech projects led by professors and their project teams to develop commercialization plans for their inventions. Building upon the project team’s concepts, this course fosters authentic learning experiences and cultivates higher-order strategic thinking skills and interdisciplinary collaboration crucial for successful commercialization. By the end of the course, students will have a thorough understanding of the commercialization process and the ability to transform inventive ideas into marketable products or services, preparing them for the challenges and opportunities in bringing innovations to market. Instructor consent is required",

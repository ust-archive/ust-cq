It is used extensively in civil and environmental engineering for site investigation, resource exploration, urban growth monitoring, detection of natural hazards (e.g., landslides, floods, earthquakes, etc) and other applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is critically needed to extract meaningful information from the vast amounts of diverse datasets generated by satellite remote sensing. This course introduces applications of AI in remote sensing. It covers the principles underlying remote sensing, various remote sensing technologies, satellite data preparation for AI analysis, and common AI techniques for remote sensing research and applications in civil and environmental engineering.",

The course starts with an extensive review of statistics, the difference between ML and descriptive statistics, discusses sampling approaches for uncertainty quantification, then covers the fundamental knowledge of supervised learning (Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian processes, deep neural networks), unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixtures), and state space models (Kalman, particle filters). The course will further emphasize on the proper use of ML for civil engineering applications, including incorporating physics-based knowledge (physics-informed ML), dealing with data acquisition challenges (design of experiment, global optimization), and so on. Students will learn to address some unique challenges of applying ML to real-world engineering applications, preparing themselves better in their future career.",

AI driven social media displacing traditional journalism. Drone warfare. Elimination of traditional jobs. Privacy‐violating advertising. Monopolistic network effects. Biased AI decision/recognition algorithms. Deepfakes. Autonomous vehicles. Automated hedge fund trading. No area remains untouched. Policy think tanks, governments, and tech companies around the world have started paying serious attention to AI ethics. How will human civilization survive the rise of AI? What are the new rules? What are the ethical frameworks needed to avoid extinction? What are engineers’ and entrepreneurs’ ethical responsibilities?",

Students who have passed COMP2633 and have gotten the instructor consent can join this course, they will be working together based on the knowledge they have learned from COMP2633 and this course, forming teams to further investigate various advanced topics related to the more practical side of cybersecurity. They will then join the various cybersecurity competitions. The students will get 2 credits for successfully completing this course. Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving. Instructor's approval is required.",

From parsing ad-hoc configuration file formats to validating complex specification languages to generating efficient code solving data-intensive problems at scale, many important problems of today and tomorrow require knowledge of basic compiler technology. The course exposes students to the essentials of modern compiler construction, including parsing, semantic analysis, program transformation, and code generation. Students will learn to design and implement their own programming language and extend it with a feature of their choice in a small team project. The course focuses on achieving these goals through effective high-level programming techniques, whose mastery will also make students a better programmer in general.",

Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment.",

These systems often appear to users as logically centralized entities, with their complex inner workings only becoming evident in the face of failures. Understanding how distributed systems function is crucial for developing resilient, scalable solutions in an interconnected world. The Distributed Systems course begins by defining distributed systems and exploring prominent architectures deployed today, such as client-server and peer-to-peer models. It then delves into fundamental concepts, including clock synchronization protocols, logical clocks, coordination and agreement protocols, and consensus algorithms, such as Paxos and Raft. Later topics include replication techniques, peer-to-peer systems, and blockchain technology, all of which are essential to modern distributed applications. Students will also engage in hands-on projects that involve the incremental development, deployment, and performance evaluation of a simplified but significant distributed system, providing practical experience that complements theoretical learning.",

Specifically, we will i) explain how a modern machine learning system (i.e., PyTorch) works; ii) understand the performance bottleneck of machine learning computation over modern hardware (e.g., Nvidia GPUs); iii) discuss four main parallel strategies in foundation model training (data-, pipeline-, tensor model-, optimizer- parallelism); iv) real-world deployment of foundation model including efficient inference and fine-tuning.",

    "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have utterly transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP) in the last 3-4 years. The relevant foundation models form the basis of state-of-art systems and become ubiquitous in solving a wide range of generative tasks in computer vision, for instance. With the unprecedented potential capabilities, these models also give rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. This course aims to cover state-of-the-art research topics, starting with technical foundations (BERT, GPT, T5 models, mixture-of-expert models, retrieval-based models), emerging capabilities (knowledge, reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning), fine-tuning and adaptation, system design, as well as security and ethics. We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to routinely read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end. This is an advanced graduate course and all the students are expected to have taken machine learning and preferably NLP courses before and are familiar with deep learning models such as Transformers.",

This suggests that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze housing. Besides, many households use mortgage loan to finance home purchase. A substantial collapse in house price might lead to negative equity for leveraged households and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. This course studies both the microeconomic and macroeconomic issues of housing. Topics include housing demand and supply analysis, equilibrium models of housing market, rationales and effects of public policies on housing, causes and consequences of housing market dynamics and crisis. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed.",

It aims to equip business leaders and strategists to understand and interpret econometric analysis in business strategy analysis, and to provide them with an understanding of three widely used techniques in modern business econometrics: randomized control trials, regression discontinuity, and differences-in-differences. Data analysis in economics, or “econometrics” as it is called by practitioners, has moved away from mathematical complexity and towards simpler tools that are accessible to businesses and can be applied easily to big data. After learning how these tools provide superior analytical results than traditional regression techniques in making inferences about the real world, business strategists will gain the practical knowledge to wield them successfully and make better business strategy decisions with real business data.",

    "description": "This course is designed to give students with little or no technical background a general understanding about robots and their potential impact. Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day‐to‐day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour‐based, cognitive and biologically-inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human‐machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. The learning process is designed to transcend conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and will be facilitated by a series of demonstrative sessions presenting students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions enabled by robotic and automation technology. In this exploration process, students will be encouraged to apply their personal background and interests, and possibly experiment with robot kits.",

    "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F.",

When well deployed, social innovations can meet social needs that the government welfare, business corporations or charity-based social welfare cannot easily fulfill. A commercial entity should also be aware of the social impacts of its business decisions. This course introduces corporate social responsibility (CSR), social innovations, and the factors of consideration to start a social enterprise. This includes current topics on operation models, sustainability, team building, case studies, strategies, practices, etc. Site visits and student projects will be involved. Instructor's approval is required for course enrollment.",

    "description": "The choices we make in daily life - the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the products and services we use - define our lifestyle. With increasing pressure through climate change and resource constraints, many people intend to consume in a sustainable manner. But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices.",

    "description": "Environmental changes, whether natural or human-induced, pose potential threats or losses to the environment and society. Called environmental risks, they can affect human health, economic development, and social stability in significant ways. Therefore, it is crucial to use scientific methods, tools, and frameworks to assess and manage these risks effectively. In this course, students will learn the concepts, principles, and methods of environmental risk assessment and management. They will also learn how to identify, quantify, assess, mitigate, and disclose environmental risks and opportunities in environmental policies, projects, or actions. Students will explore the causes, impacts, and responses of different types of environmental risks. They will also consider how these risks intersect with social justice issues, and how they can challenge and transform the power structures and inequalities that underlie environmental challenges. Finally, students will apply their knowledge and skills to real-world case studies, using various tools and frameworks, as well as understand the importance of transparent environmental risk reporting in corporate finance.",

Students will “invest” alongside VC practitioners as well as being guided by them on various topics such as screening prospective investee companies in a live pitch session and drafting and compiling due diligence lists, term sheets, the required closing documentations, and valuation assessments, in addition to presenting early-read memos to industry professionals (e.g., members of the investment committee (IC)) for deal approvals, among other topics. The professor will frequently relate concepts discussed in class to transactions currently in the news to illustrate their application and limitations.",

In order to support and grow the structured product business, a variety of functions or roles are developed in the financial industry, including traders, quants, structurers, and sales, etc. at investment banks or relationship managers and product specialists at private banks. As a result, all the financial practitioners are assumed to have basic and practical knowledge about structured products. This course is designed for students who are pursuing front-office careers at investment banks, private banks, or asset management companies. It covers basic concepts of structured products, introduces popular products in the market (e.g., principal protected notes and equity-linked notes), and discusses the landscape of product manufacturing and distribution process. It focuses on applications rather than theory by illustrating real-world examples as well as their practical implementations in the industry.",

    "description": "Over the past several decades, the field of finance has developed a successful paradigm based on the notions that investors and managers were generally rational and the prices of securities were generally “efficient”.  In recent years, however, anecdotal evidence as well as theoretical and empirical research has shown this paradigm to be insufficient to describe various features of actual financial markets.  In this course we will use psychology and more realistic settings to guide and develop alternative theories of financial markets. We will examine how the insights of behavioral finance complement the traditional paradigm and shed light on investors' trading patterns, the behavior of asset prices, corporate finance, and various Wall Street institutions and practices. In particular, we will discuss how behavioral biases leads to stock return predictability and thus cross-sectional trading strategies.",

Climate and transition finance (investments in systems, companies and projects that sequester carbon, avoid emissions and fund renewable energy) and the creation of new financial instruments that price carbon emissions – is a critical part of this required transformation of the global economy. This course will explore the financial tools that can be used to mitigate the impacts of climate change and accelerate the sequestration and capture of carbon. Focus areas are: capital markets and exchanges, emissions trading systems, investments in low emissions technologies, project finance for nature-based climate solutions, renewable energy and other project types, corporate finance of decarbonization, carbon credits/offsets, and related regulatory changes.",

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

    "description": "Languages are considered complex repositories of cultures, where meanings are created and articulated, verbally and non-verbally, about the artefacts, norms, beliefs, and values of cultures. Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

This course will cover the fundamental techniques of capturing stones, common life-and-death shapes, basic joseki, and opening theory in Weiqi, as well as how to complete a full game against an opponent. By participating in this Weiqi course, students can gain insights into the origin and development trajectory of Weiqi culture, stories of prominent figures, and its implications on artificial intelligence (AI), one of the hottest topics today. Weiqi is more than a game and a cultural carrier. It is hoped that Weiqi will become one of students’ lifelong hobbies.",

    "description": "This course aims to stimulate students’ thinking around the complex notion of ‘identity’, challenging classic sociolinguistic and sociological approaches and introducing poststructuralist approaches. The language of individuals and/or institutions will be analysed in depth, with reference to critical theories of society, ideology and discourse. The course also aims to raise awareness of how language is used to create and maintain power through narratives of identity. Case studies will be presented, with a view to deconstructionist analysis on the role of language in producing and reproducing ostensibly stable ‘identities’ along binary lines such as masculine/feminine, Western/Asian and straight/queer. The course also investigates how humans perform other types of social difference and belonging such as ethnicity and social class.",

Since we will be working with 'concrete sound', students need not have any prior experience in music notation or composition to participate in the course. The course will culminate in an open concert-presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester.",

Given its sweeping impact worldwide, we can no longer dismiss it as mere pop culture and entertainment. Indeed, anime has gradually emerged as a new field of research, dominating film histories and theories in the academia. This course offers an overview of anime by examining its histories, techniques and technologies, medium, genres, and conceptual issues. It will track anime’s early years, development, industrialization, globalization, and explosive boom in the digital age. Focusing on cinema features and TV series, this course will explore a variety of overlapping (sub)genres, such as Robot, Mecha, Cyberpunk, Apocalypse, Adventure, Supernatural, Shōjo, and Tragedy. Conceptual issues like cuteness, gender, sexuality, race, nation, environment, human-machine interaction, AI and posthumanism will be examined closely. Japanese language and knowledge are welcome but not required for this course.",

    "name": "Global History: New Anthropological Perspectives",
    "description": "This course takes on the broad sweep of human history from an anthropological perspective, highlighting the great social and cultural diversity of human experience. Popular accounts of global history depict human society evolving stepwise in a unilinear fashion: egalitarian hunter-gatherers gave way to hierarchical agricultural societies before the rise of cities and, later, the establishment of states. New archaeological and anthropological discoveries are now challenging such picture: the trajectory of human history, it turns out, has been much more diverse and unpredictable than previously imagined. The course will delve into anthropological phenomena that showcase this diversity, such as hunter-gatherers’ seasonality, ‘play agriculture’ in Amazonia, egalitarian cities, urban revolutions in Mesoamerica, or stranger-kings across the Pacific. These case studies, analyzed through modern anthropological theory, reveal the profound role of collective intentionality in shaping our history. They cast light on the past while also providing insights into the possibilities of the future.",

The course will culminate in an open concert presentation of final works that students will have developed over the semester in consultation with the instructor. Approval of the course instructor is needed for students to enroll in this course. Students should have prior experience with electronic music.

In other words, it emphasizes the cultural and historical situatedness of any understanding of the body throughout human history.",

Recently animation theories began to emerge as a new field of research, offering critical interventions in film studies and even challenging our conventional views of the world. This course explores various theoretical issues in animation studies, such as movement, stasis, affect, automation and agency, TV serialization, digitality, media mix, sound, authorship and spectatorship, animals, race, gender, cuteness, animism and environment. Animated films made in China, Japan, and other parts of the world will be analyzed as case studies.",

    "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

Research on existing solutions and how to conduct the stakeholder and market analyses will be taught for designing the needs screening matrix in needs selection. Students are going to unlock their creativity potentials through the in-class activities.The new ideas of addressing the unmet needs are generated in which the ideas are grouped ad organized into a concept map. To translate a promising concept from an idea into a rudimentary design, the concept exploration is facilitated by prototyping. The prototypes are tested by the potential users. This course aims to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, analytical, design and project management skills.",

Students learn about fundamental design theories, principles, and methods through a project-based learning approach. Students then experience several stages of a creative design process. The process begins by asking students to identify real-world problems through social, business, scientific, and technological perspectives. To add specificity, students will be able to describe the behaviors and needs of social interactions, observe demographic phenomena, assess business viability, and identify and understand technological changes and impacts, etc. After defining a problem statement, students will be guided to generate creative solutions using brainstorming tools and creative thinking skills. Selected solutions will be presented in form of prototypes and open for user feedback. This course emphasizes the appreciation of the role and significance of design for our society.",

Brand assets such as the logo, brand fonts and secondary graphics, brand tone, tools and touch points (and much more); and how they are structured, designed and developed via brand frameworks and branding strategies will be explored through a series of lectures and in-class exercises. The course will culminate in an extended hands-on project. Guest speaker(s) will also be invited to give context and insight into the practice and profession.",

Identification of the problem through interactions with the staff of the sponsored company. Ideation. Design concept generation. Selection of ideas. Prototyping. Testing and redesigning. In addition, students have to consider sustainability, manufacturability, and marketability of the proposed product solutions, which have to fulfill needs of the client under a budgetary constraint. Students are expected to spend less time on planning and idea generation as they have already gained these experiences in the second year but more time on prototyping and testing, as this project requires application and integration of more advance technologies and design.

The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This course will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations. Students will also have the opportunity to apply these concepts in various service industries by conducting a group project.",

Unlike traditional product markets, a salient feature of these industries is that services are intangible and not storable, and often highly variable, which raises significant challenges in decision making. The goal of this course is to improve the understanding of these challenges and to learn how to overcome the obstacles with data-driven quantitative models. This class will introduce simple predictive and prescriptive methods that are useful in service operations.",

We have seen the founder who has started four businesses in 15 years and brought the company he created to an IPO three times, bringing back incredible wealth for himself, his investors and his company team. Examples like these show that there is a trajectory of success for a company from Idea at the time of founding to an IPO, although with a very high demise rate. On this path, founders, management teams and investors are required to choose the mode of mutual fulfillment and code of conduct of compromise and mutual tolerance while playing for their own interests in order to follow the right trajectory.",

The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills.

It increases student awareness of how writing creates change and convinces one to take action, and how audiences, contexts and genre call for different choices in language, organization, format and style. As students explore and analyze business genres, they learn how to shape and adapt their language skills, strategies and communication practices to meet the needs of various internal and external audiences including co-workers, supervisors, management and customers. The course also develops in students the ability to communicate in digital contexts by analyzing and producing texts including on email and social media. Students will develop a repertoire of language and communication skills and strategies and will write for various workplace needs. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

    "description": "This course equips students with the language and communication skills and strategies to speak and present professionally in internal and external business settings. It increases student awareness of how speaking and presenting creates change and convinces one to take action. As students explore and analyze spoken genres using language and communication theories, they learn how to shape and adapt their language skills, strategies and communication practices to influence various internal and external audiences including customers, co-workers and supervisors. Students will also develop ways to express themselves in multimodal settings. The course develops in students particularly with soft skills to handle sensitive business situations and incidents including a crisis, and how to communicate interculturally in diverse settings. Students will develop a repertoire of language and communication skills and strategies to meet various workplace needs. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

It increases student awareness of how disciplinary conventions, genre and rhetorical situations call for different choices in language, organization, format, citation and style. As students explore and analyze academic disciplinary genres and their research and writing process they learn how to use advanced language skills and strategies including developing stances, defining, explaining, reporting, analyzing, synthesizing and organizing and how to repurpose academic content to communicate ideas effectively. The course also develops in students the view of writing as a social process as they work with a community of writers who share ideas, give feedback and support. It creates writers who are engaged to demonstrate their writing in various ways including a small-scale research project. The course threads competencies in communication, problem-solving and personal development including lifelong learning and awareness to help students develop transferable skills to become effective writers in their academic disciplines. For all SBM programs, BIBU, MAEC, T&M-DDP, SGFN & QSA students.",

The success of making mRNA vaccines encourages scientists to develop mRNA-based drugs to treat different diseases in the future. This experiential learning course focuses on applying several essential RNA-related technologies in diagnosing and treating human diseases. The course introduces the basic knowledge of RNAs, fundamental principles on RNA-related technologies, and experimental practices for RNA technologies. After learning the basics of RNAs and the principles of six RNA technologies, students will work in teams to develop their projects, and design experiments to make their RNA-related products. By the end of the course, each team will conduct experiments, collect the data, and present and discuss their results at the end of the course.

This course emphasizes the essential components of pharmaceutical development; discusses the key stages and decision points in the process; and gives a detailed analysis on the quality control and regulatory requirements. The technological and financial requirements of the development of pharmaceutical products are also covered. Professional training in these disciplines, lacking in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, is crucial for students who plan to pursue further studies or develop their career in the biotechnology sectors.",

    "description": "This reading course is ideal for students enroled in Algebraic Geometry II or those pursuing algebraic geometry studies independently. It primarily addresses two topics: I. Derived Categories and II. Geometric invariant theory (GIT). Additionally, the course explores the connections between these topics, focusing on III. Derived categories of GIT quotients, as developed by Halpern-Leistner [HL] and Ballard, Favero and Katzarkov [BFK]. Derived categories, first introduced by Grothendieck and Verdier for studying Grothendieck’s duality, have since become indispensable tools in algebraic geometry, representing fundamental invariants of algebraic varieties. Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) plays a critical role in studying quotients in algebraic geometry and constructing moduli spaces. A seminal result in the study of GIT quotients is the Kirwan surjectivity theorem, which establishes a surjective map from the equivariant cohomology of a space X to its GIT quotient X//G, with an explicitly y understood kernel. This reading course aims to explore a categorification of this surjectivity, as developed by [HL] and [BFK], which has broad implications in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics. This course will operate in a seminar/presentation format, where each participant is expected to lead one or two sessions. Each session will span approximately 2 to 3 hours. Students should seek approval from the course instructor to take this reading course.",

The course's aim is to broaden the professional and engineering interests of students by enhancing their practicum/team-based experience through initiatives different from those of traditional lectures and tutorials. The training is project-based to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project.",

    "description": "What business can generate long-term profit? What is the most important topic in this era? What are the most critical challenges to our human society? All these go to sustainability. From the inception of the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s to the ambitious goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, the need for sustainable practices has become increasingly apparent. The rise of solar power, the surge in popularity of electric cars, and the debates surrounding genetically modified food are all indicative of the complex and interrelated issues we face today. Extreme weather events and the ever-pressing threat of climate change further compound the urgency of our situation. As an engineer, your role extends beyond acquiring strong technical knowledge and skills. It necessitates an acute awareness of the urgent social, political, and environmental needs that shape our world. This course aims to equip you with the necessary tools to address these challenges. We will introduce and elucidate the fundamental design concepts, methods, tools, and technologies associated with lean and green manufacturing systems, supply chains, and green energy. It will also encompass the evaluation, design, and maintenance of environmentally friendly products, processes, services, and policies. Note that knowledge of Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering is also a requirement outlined by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) accreditation criteria.",

The course starts by reviewing the formation of a vibrant market economy in China from 1700 onward and introduce progress made in the studies of Chinese economic history. This historical background is important to view the socio-economic characteristics of the pre-1949 Chinese society and their relevance to modern economic growth. This course also exposes the students to the basic concepts and analytic tools in political economy such as market economy, the state, conflict of interests, correlation and causality, and selection bias. This illustrates the importance of causal explanations in social scientific inquiry.",

Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions.

    "description": "This course will focus on specific CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) issues facing companies today. Along with changing attitudes, new global regulatory CSR requirements are increasingly putting firms under pressure to demonstrate positive social and environmental impacts, while maintaining their commitments to investors. Students will investigate how actual firms are managing these pressures while continuing to address the needs of their stakeholders. Incorporating aspects of the benchmark standards such as the GRI and various ESG (Environmental Social Governance) initiatives will help students to strengthen their own knowledge, skill, and attitudes in this area. The course has an embedded project, with direct links to one or more businesses, which will give students the necessary practical grounding for effectively understanding the challenges of CSR in the contemporary business environment.",

Influencing others also requires productive working relationships. This course is designed for full-time MBA students who may spend part of their careers in roles where they will advise clients: consultants (including “in-house”), investment bankers, client relationship managers, etc. The lessons can also be applied to a range of other business relationships you will need (with supervisors, colleagues, direct reports, JV partners, etc.). You may also hire advisors in the future. Understanding the principles of effective advisory relationships can help you choose the right advisors and establish productive relationships. The course will primarily focus on the ‘day-to-day’ client relationship practices that will help establish you as a competent professional, a trusted advisor, and an influential change leader. As a secondary benefit, you will gain an appreciation for how high performing professional service firms operate. To maximize your learning, we will identify specific ways you can put these insights to work during internships or your first job after graduation. Graded P or F.",

It centers on an experiential learning program that will require students to develop and pitch an innovation-oriented project. Depending on the student’s career and life goals, this project may consist of a business plan for a startup, a project proposal for their corporate employers, or a new business line for their family businesses. At the end of the course, students will pitch their proposals to a panel of successful innovators whose careers spanned across intrapreneurship, entrepreneurship, and venture capital. Throughout the process, students will experience personal self-discovery and learn about practical tools for pursuing a career in innovation. The course is taught by two instructors: an academic turned entrepreneur and a product manager who began as an intrapreneur before becoming an entrepreneur and later, a venture capitalist.",

It will examine the basics of how bi/multilingualism is defined and measured, types of bi/multilingualism, and bi/multilingual language behaviors. The second part of the course explores foundations of bi/multilingual language education. Topics include second language versus bilingual acquisition, bilingualism and cognition, and bilingual education for bilingualism and biliteracy. The third part of the course focuses on pedagogical issues and practices in bi/multilingual language education. We will discuss the uses and roles of translation in language teaching, translanguaging in pedagogy, and mixed code and classroom code-switching, with special attention given to the teaching of Chinese and English in the context of Hong Kong.

This course also offers a critical survey of important issues related to Chinese script in modern times, including simplification, Romanization (Latinization), recognition, and adaptability to various Sinitic and Sinosphere languages, taking into consideration research in general linguistics, sociolinguistics, and heritage history.

    "description": "The course is designed to strengthen students’ competence in teaching. It comprises 2 parts: Part 1 aims to equip all full-time research postgraduate (RPg) students with basic teaching skills before assuming teaching assistant duties for the department. Good teaching skills can be acquired through learning and practice.  This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course. MPhil students are required to give at least one 30-minute session of instructional delivery in front of a group of students for one term. PhD students are required to give at least one such session each in two different terms. Graded PP, P or F.",

    "description": "PHYS 1111 and PHYS 1112 target students who have learned the most basic knowledge in physics in high school. Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. Students without the physics prerequisite but who have taken PHYS 1101 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but who have taken MATH 1012/ MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.",

What do we know about the relationships between government decisions and the economic and environmental performance of energy systems? The class begins with an overview of energy-related challenges confronted by policymakers: climate change, energy poverty, the competition for natural resources, and barriers to sustainable energy use and innovation needs. Policy types are introduced through the lens of energy technologies and their historial/ ongoing development. We examine the role of data, models, and uncertainties in policy decisions. The primary focus of the course is international.",

It introduces students to key concepts in the discipline of public management and covers major approaches to management in the public sector. The course begins with a review of the evolution of thinking from public administration to public management. It allows students to explore the changes of responsibilities and skills of public managers. From that basis, we move to look at tools in important functional areas of public management and investigate how to critically apply a range of mechanisms to improve the performance of public managers.",

    "description": "The global financial crisis was not just an economic calamity. It also precipitated a crisis in economic and political ideas. The pre-crisis faith that free markets produce optimal outcomes has been significantly eroded. A decade on, global policymakers still struggle to engage with a more empirically-grounded and less dogmatic brand of economics, and the differing prescriptions that it might suggest. Students of economics need to have an overview of the causes and consequences of the crisis, the ideas that contributed to it, and how those ideas and their policy implications are being challenged and debated. Most importantly, students of public policy need to be able to understand what went wrong – both in economics, and in policy.",

At the same time, the pandemic has raised doubts about the prospects of emerging markets. Both the pandemic-induced global recession and the possible reversal of globalization threaten the gains emerging markets have made in recent decades. Using growth diagnostics, this course examines the economic prospects of the key emerging markets in Asia – China, India, the ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), draws lessons for development policy, and examines the implications for emerging markets in a pandemic-disrupted world.",

This module gives students a broad introduction to the key disruptive technologies that are likely to transform our economy and society in the next decade or so. We will examine the practical applications of these technologies and discuss their policy implications and socioeconomic impacts. We will also look at the potential for governments to leverage new digital technologies to deliver new services or improve existing ones and enhance public value. Above all, we will examine the implications for public policy and how government should respond.",

    "description": "The impact of climate change on humanity and ecosystems is broader and more severe than anticipated. Urgent and systemic transitions are required to ensure a future with net zero emissions and climate resilience, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, achieving climate goals faces significant challenges, one of most important being the investment gap. First, existing funding flows fall far below the required scale for the future. Second, the growth momentum of the private sector remains insufficient. Third, limitations in fund allocation result in inadequate support for the most vulnerable sectors, industries and groups of population, with over 90% of funds directed toward climate mitigation and less than 10% toward adaptation. In short, accelerating climate action is only feasible with a several-fold increase in financing. The first part of this course introduces students to the foundations of green and sustainable finance, such as its definition, markets and instruments. The second part of this course follows the CFA Institute’s Certificate in ESG Investing curriculum to make sure that the students are equipped with the most up to date information on green and sustainable finance. At the end of the semester, students should have a strong background to be able to study for the certification, which will give them a cutting edge when applying for jobs related to ESG and sustainability.",

    "name": "The Rise, Fall, and Contemporary Resurgence of the East Asian Developmental State Model",
    "description": "The East Asian developmental state model represents a unique blend of state-led macroeconomic planning, heavily interventionist industrial policies, severe labor suppression, and capitalist markets. Despite intermittent financial crises, cronyism, and corruption, it has been credited with producing the most impressive economic growth miracles of the 20th century, including but not limited to that of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and even Mainland China since Deng Xiaoping’s experiments with reform and opening up, leading many experts and policymakers to refer to the region as the “growth driver” and “anchor of stability” of the global economy. The model has dominated the political and economic landscape of East Asia from the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, when the rise of neoliberalism gradually shrunk the policy space for state intervention, and successive waves of democratization, as incomplete and flawed as they sometimes were, placed limits on the severity of labor suppression, putting in question the continued feasibility and even desirability of the model. However, in the 21st century, at least three major developments have resulted in the contemporary resurgence of the East Asian developmental state model, albeit in an evolved form: (1) greater acceptance and even demand for increased state intervention following neoliberalism’s retreat in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; (2) increased protectionism as an integral part of the new Cold War race for technological supremacy between the United States and Mainland China (especially in terms of advanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence); and (3) the deglobalization and regionalization of value chains following the Covid-19 pandemic. In this course, we will analyze the historical and contemporary application of the East Asian developmental state model in a wide variety of political and economic contexts, its merits and demerits in these contexts, and its potential to further evolve and adapt to new geopolitical and geoeconomic realities. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on state-market relations, industrial and labor policies, and technological upgrading.",

    "description": "As one of the earliest concerns of moral and political discourse, corruption has long blighted human affairs, and it represents one of the most serious global threats of our time. Its effects are wide-ranging, with corruption having been found to distort human judgment, warp the organizational cultures of governmental and business institutions, undermine economic and political development, increase poverty, compromise human rights, corrode the integrity of economic and political systems, cause extreme inequalities, destroy public confidence in governments and markets, and undercut environmental protection and climate change policies. In this course, we will connect theory with practice to identify the causes and consequences of public and private sector corruption in different policy areas and contexts, and analyze the effectiveness of a wide variety of responses, measures, and strategies designed to prevent and combat it. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on ethics and integrity, good governance, and the role of modern technologies in both facilitating and fighting corruption.",

    "description": "This course explores the complex intersection of crisis management and public policy. Through intensive case discussions and analysis, students will examine how different levels of governments, types of organizations, expert advisors, and policy implementers navigate context-specific challenges while developing and implementing effective policy responses. The course bridges theoretical foundations with real-world applications, focusing on the unique dynamics of policymaking under pressure, strategic decision-making processes, and institutional responses to various types of crises under contextual constraints. Using carefully selected cases that span public health emergencies, natural disasters, economic upheavals, and political crises from all over the world, each session will center on in-depth case discussions, requiring students to assume the role of decision-makers and critically analyze the challenges, constraints, and strategic choices faced by policymakers during crisis situations. Using the case method as the primary pedagogical approach, this course emphasizes active learning through case preparation, group discussions, and real-time decision-making exercises. This approach is complemented by theoretical readings that provide frameworks for understanding crisis management in the public policy domain. The course adopts an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from public policy, management and leadership, behaviour science, and communication studies. Special attention is given to emerging challenges in crisis management, including the impact of social media/A.I., low levels of trust in government, and the use of innovative technologies on crisis response capabilities.

Tomorrow’s employees and executives may not need the advanced skills of a data scientist, but they must be data literate. Therefore, there is a need to bring together data skills and business management by introducing a common core course, specializing at applying data analytics techniques to business scenarios for the implementation of business intelligence. The aim of this course is to introduce the general workflow of business intelligence and various applications of data analytics models in business scenarios. The course also focuses on an analysis of the strengths, limitations, causes and benefits of the use of business intelligence. The course also includes hands-on practical exercises by using data mining and statistics models on real business data sets.",

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of your life. We also touch on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout your life. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following your HKUST graduation. For Science students only. Graded P or F.",

This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of this course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and  descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn from real-world data. Upon completion of this course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as better understanding of social science research.

It will discuss the normative foundations of democracy, the relationship between individual rights and rule by majority; the procedural and substantive aspects of democracy, and how to conceptualize the common good or public interest in democracy. It encourages students to apply the knowledge of democracy learnt in class to critically evaluate existing political systems and diverse social issues that they face in everyday life. Through in-depth examination of democracy as a normative value, this course will also encourage students to reflect the implications of democracy as a theory to various practical socio-political issues in today’s world.",

It focuses on China's transformation from a closed and state-controlled economy to a market-oriented, increasingly internationalized, and predominantly private economy. It begins with an overview of the Maoist economic system since the communist revolution in 1949. It then examines how the rules governing economic activities have been redefined in major economic sectors since 1978. It also highlights the main features of the new, capitalistic economy and reflects on the issues and challenges that have emerged during the transformation of the economy.",

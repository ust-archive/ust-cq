The course starts with the design/construction interface and focuses on the Contractor’s perspective. In particular, ground improvements, reclamation works, excavation-lateral support system and modular construction as well as digital construction will be highlighted. With an aim to help students who have limited exposure to construction practice, this course uses a Capstone project to help the students to form a comprehensive view of a construction project, including site layouts, construction practice, contract type, and construction methods. Students would be required to apply the knowledge learned to describe a real-life construction project and critically analyze the construction activities.",

The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills.

    "description": "Percolation theory is the study of random connected components that appear if one removes edges or vertices of a graph according to a certain prescribed rule. The particularly simple model of Bernoulli percolation has originally been devised as a description for porous media by Broadbent and Hammersley in the 1950s, and its mathematically rich phenomenology has attracted much attention since then. The principal objective of this independent study course is to study important techniques used in Bernoulli percolation on Zd, d ≥ 2, in particular the FKG- and BK-inequalities, enhancements, exponential decay, renormalization, the Burton-Keane argument, and planar techniques such as Russo-Seymour-Welsh (RSW) theory. Towards the end, certain extensions of Bernoulli percolation models (correlated percolation, continuum percolation) will also be shortly discussed. Some familiarity with concepts from measure-theoretic probability theory (on the level of MATH 2431 Honors Probability) is helpful to follow this course. Students should seek the course instructor's approval to take this course.",

It will explore how to make cities more sustainable in terms of environmental, social, and economic aspects and equip students with the theoretical and methodological tools to draft and analyze strategies and their viability. The course will also introduce and evaluate various approaches to foster more sustainable and resilient forms of urbanization and urban life, such as localization, industrial symbiosis, and ecological restoration and review processes of reducing the dependence on external resources and increasing the local production and consumption of goods and services. These approaches will be examined in different contexts and scales, from local to global, and from individual to collective.",

    "description": "Why is poverty such an intractable problem in a world of unprecedented wealth? Why does global inequality keep increasing in most of the world, and why has this problem been ignored for such a long time? Why are some countries able to develop and others not? And perhaps most uncomfortably, is it possible to achieve universal progress on poverty, inequality, and development, or does progress necessarily mean that some people and countries fall behind as others advance in the current systemic configuration? In this course, we will draw on key theories of political economy and development as well as on long-standing debates in the history of development thought and practice to try and answer these and other related questions, and critically evaluate a wide range of mainstream and alternative development models and issues, and the complex politics behind them. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, as well as to anyone wanting to understand poverty, inequality, and development better and to make a difference.",

Quantitative reasoning is at the core of all topics covered. Guided by examples from both classic and contemporary scientific findings, students will learn to move beyond phenomenological descriptions and (re)think biology in terms of quantitative and generalizable principles. Along the way, students will cultivate an appreciation for numbers, equations, and math models as effective tools for describing, comprehending, and predicting living systems.",

But such advances have also raised critical issues, many of which have adverse effects on our health. In this course, students will examine the appearance of health issues as a result of technological 'advances', and what their solutions have been. It will also examine major health problems that have had a great impact on our community and their causes; and the place of science and technology in dealing with related problems. The role of technology in maintaining good public health and handing possible public health crises are also explored. Finally, this course seeks to develop students' ability to evaluate public health issues from different perspectives, taking into account scientific, historical, moral, social, ethical and cultural factors.",
